<notediv><title><b>Compiler's Note</b><br set="CENTER" /></title><note><p>To speed publication, the Acts and Resolutions of the extraordinary session, with the exception of the proposed amendments to the Constitution, were sent to the printer in the order in which they were released from the Governor's office. This made only a broad classification possible.</p><p>General Acts and Resolutions were grouped in one volume beginning at page 1 and running through page 416. The proposed amendments to the Constitution were grouped together beginning at page 223 of Volume One.</p><p>Local and Special Acts and Resolutions were grouped in one volume beginning on page 2001.</p><p>There are no intervening pages between 416 and 2000.</p><p>The index, beginning at page 2365, covers material included in both volumes. It is in two parts: a broad tabular index which attempts to supply some of the advantages which might have been gained from a more detailed classification, which speed of publication made impossible. This is followed by a regular alphabetical index.</p></note></notediv>

Otherwise, the registration card shall be marked rejected. If the applicant states that solely because of physical disability, he is unable to read or write, the paragraph shall be read to him by a registration officer and he shall be called upon to give a reasonable interpretation thereof. The interpretation shall give to the words the significance ordinarily attached to them by a layman of average intellect and attainments.

The registrars shall purge such list before filing it of the names of all persons who will not be qualified to vote at such primary or election. All electors on such list shall have the same rights as to primaries and elections held subsequent to such primary or election as persons on the list for the preceding November election.</p><p><b>Section 34-626. Registration of persons to vote in special primaries and elections.</b>Any person who has registered for a general primary or election, if otherwise qualified to vote at any special primary or election occurring before the next November election shall be listed and entitled to vote at such special primary or election.

Public notice of the time and place of the test shall be made at least five days prior thereto. Representatives of political parties and bodies, candidates, news media, and the public shall be permitted to observe such tests. The test shall be conducted by processing a preaudited group of ballot cards so punched or marked as to record a pre-determined number of valid votes for each candidate and on each question, and shall include for each office one or more ballot cards which have votes in excess of the number allowed by law in order to test the ability of the tabulating machine to reject such

With these exceptions, no write-in ballot shall be cast on a voting machine for any person for any office, whose name appears on the machine as a candidate for that office, and any ballot so cast shall be void and not counted.</p><p>(e) At any general election at which presidential electors are to be chosen, each elector shall be permitted to vote by one operation for all the presidential electors of a political party or body. For each party or body nominating presidential electors, a ballot label shall be provided containing only the words Presidential Electors, preceded by the name of the party or body and followed by the names of the candidates thereof for the office of President and Vice President, and the corresponding counter or registering device shall register votes cast for such presidential electors when thus voted for collectively. If an elector desires to vote a ticket for presidential electors made up of the names of persons nominated by different parties or bodies, or partially of names of persons so in nomination and partially of names of persons not in nomination by any party or body, or wholly of names of persons not in nomination by any party or body, he may write or deposit a paper ballot prepared by himself in the receptacle provided in or on the machine for the purpose.

Any ballot marked by anything but pen or pencil shall be void and not counted. Any erasure, mutilation or defect in the vote for any candidate shall render void the vote for such candidate, but shall not invalidate the votes cast on the remainder of the ballot, if otherwise properly marked. If an elector shall mark his ballot for more persons for any nomination or office than there are candidates to be voted for for such nomination or office, or if, for any reason, it may be impossible to determine his choice for any nomination or office, his ballot shall not be counted for such nomination or office, but the ballot shall be counted for all nominations or offices for which it is properly marked.

Any erasure, mutilation or defective marking of the straight party or body column at general elections shall render the entire ballot void, unless the elector has properly indicated his choice for candidates in any other column, in which case the vote or votes for such candidates only shall be counted. Any ballot indicating a write-in vote for any person whose name is not printed on the ballot, shall be counted as a vote for such person, if written in the proper space or spaces provided for that purpose, whether or not a cross (X) or check ([UNK]) mark is placed before the name of such person.</p><p><b>Section 34-1323.

The managers shall examine the affidavit and jurat of each envelope. If the managers are satisfied that the affidavit and jurat are sufficient and that the absentee elector is otherwise qualified to vote, a manager shall announce the name of the elector and shall give any person present an opportunity to challenge in like manner and for the same cause as the elector could have been challenged had he presented himself in such district to vote other than by official absentee ballot. Also, the managers shall consider any absentee elector challenged when a person has previously filed with it a written challenge of such elector's right to vote. A manager shall then open the envelope in such manner as not to destroy the affidavit and jurat printed thereon and shall deposit the inner envelope, marked Official Absentee Ballot, in a ballot box reserved for absentee ballots. The managers shall record on their numbered list of voters the name of each elector whose official absentee ballot is cast at such polling place.</p><p>(c) If the managers shall find that the affidavit or jurat is insufficient or that the absentee elector is otherwise disqualified to vote, the envelope shall not be opened and a poll officer shall write across the face of the envelope, Rejected, giving the reason therefor, and the board of registrars shall promptly notify the elector of such rejection.</p><p>(d) If an absentee elector's right to vote has been challenged for cause, a poll officer shall open the envelopes and write Challenged, the elector's name and the alleged cause of challenge on the back of the ballot, without disclosing

Cancellation of ballots of electors present during primaries and elections.</b>Whenever an elector (other than one whose physical disability prevents his attendance at the polls) is present in the county of his residence during the time the polls are open in any primary or election for which he has returned an absentee ballot for voting, such elector shall immediately appear in person before the registrars and shall request in writing that the envelope containing his absentee ballot be marked Cancelled. The registrars, after having satisfied themselves as to the identity of such elector, shall thereupon grant the request and shall notify the managers of his election district as to such action so as to permit him to vote in person in his district. Cancelled absentee ballots shall remain sealed in their envelopes and shall be disposed of in the same manner as Section 34-1407 (a) provides for absentee ballots returned too late to be cast.</p><p><b>Section 34-1410. Postage; air mail.</b>The postage required for mailing ballots to absentee electors, as provided in this Chapter, shall be paid by the county, except in cases where free mail delivery is furnished by the Federal Government.

In the case of districts in which voting machines are used, there shall be read from the general return the identifying number or other designation of each voting machine used, the numbers registered on the protective counter or device on each machine prior to the opening of the polls and immediately after close of the same, whereupon the assistant having charge of the records of the superintendent showing the number registered on the protective counter or device of each voting machine prior to delivery at the polling place, shall publicly announce the numbers so registered, and unless it appears that such records, and such general return correspond, no further returns shall be read from the latter until any and all discrepancies are explained to the satisfaction of the superintendent.</p><p>(d) (i) In districts in which paper ballots have been used, when the records agree with such returns regarding the number of ballots and the number of votes recorded for each candidate, such votes for each candidate shall be read by an assistant slowly, audibly and in an orderly manner from the general return which has been returned unsealed, and the figures announced shall be compared by other assistants with the general return which has been returned sealed. The figures announced for all districts shall be compared by one of the assistants with the tally papers from the respective districts. If any discrepancies are discovered, the superintendent shall thereupon examine all of the return sheets, tally papers and other papers in his possession relating to the same election district.

If any discrepancies are discovered, the superintendent shall thereupon examine all of the return sheets, proof sheets and other papers in his possession relating to the same election district. Such proof sheets shall be deemed to be prima facie evidence of the result of the primary or election and to be prima facie accurate, and if the proper proof sheets properly identified, shall be mutually consistent, and if the general and duplicate returns, or either of them, from such district shall not correspond with such proof sheets, they shall be corrected so as to correspond with same, in the absence of allegation of specific fraud or error, proved to the satisfaction of the superintendent.</p><p>(iii) If any error or fraud is discovered, the superintendent shall compute and certify the votes justly regardless of any fraudulent or erroneous returns presented to him, and shall report the facts to the appropriate solicitor general for action.</p><p>(e) (i) In primaries and elections in which vote recorders have been used, the ballot cards shall be counted at one or more tabulating machine centers under the direction of the superintendent.

The ballot cards of each polling place shall be plainly identified and not commingled with the ballot cards of other polling places.</p><p>(iii) If it apepars that a ballot card is so torn, bent or otherwise defective that it cannot be processed by the tabulating machine, the officer in charge of the tabulating machine shall have a true duplicate copy prepared for processing with the ballot cards of the same polling place, which shall be verified in the presence of a witness.

Each counter shall be reset at zero (000) before it is tested, after which it shall be operated at least one hundred times. After the completion of such examination and test, the custodian shall then and there prepare a statement, in writing, giving in detail the result of the examination and test, and such statement shall be witnessed by the persons present, and shall be filed with the superintendent. If, upon such recanvass, it shall appear that the original canvass of the returns by the poll officers was incorrect, such returns and all papers being prepared by the superintendent shall be corrected accordingly; provided, however, that in the case of returns from any election district wherein the primary or election was held by the use of a voting machine equipped with mechanism for printing paper proof sheets, such proof sheets, if mutually consistent, shall be deemed to be prima facie evidence of the result of the primary or election and to be prima facie accurate, and there shall not be considered to be any discrepancy or error in the returns from any such district, such as to require a recanvass of the vote, if all available proof sheets, from the voting machine used therein, identified to the satisfaction of the superintendent and shown to his satisfaction to have been produced from proper custody, shall be mutually consistent, and, if the general and duplicate returns, or either of them, from such district shall not correspond with such proof sheets, they, and all other papers being prepared by the superintendent, shall be corrected so as to correspond with the same, in the absence of allegation of specific fraud or error, proved to the satisfaction of the superintendent by the weight of the evidence, and only in such case shall the vote of such election district be recanvassed under the provisions of this Section.</p><p>(h) As the returns from each election district are read, computed and found to be correct or corrected as aforesaid,

The court shall give to the jury such explanation and instruction concerning the matter thus submitted as may be necessary to enable the jury to make its findings upon each issue. If in so doing the court omits any issue of fact raised by the pleadings or by the evidence, each party waives his right to a trial by jury of the issue so omitted unless before the jury retires he demands its submission to the jury.

Proceeds of Bonds</b>The proceeds of such bonds shall be used solely for the payment of the cost of the project or projects, and unless otherwise provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust indenture, additional bonds may in like manner be issued to provide the amount of any deficit for the cost of the project or projects, which unless otherwise provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust indenture shall be deemed to be of the same issue and shall be entitled to payment from the same fund without preference or priority of the bonds first issued for the same purposes. If the proceeds of the bonds of any issue shall exceed the amount required for the purpose for which such bonds are issued, the surplus shall be paid into a sinking fund or used for additional construction as may be provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust indenture.</p><p><b>Section 14. Interim Receipts and Certificates or Temporary Bonds</b>Prior to the preparation of definitive bonds, the Authority may, under like restrictions issue interim receipts, interim certificates or temporary bonds, with or without coupons exchangeable for definitive bonds upon the issuance of the latter.</p><p><b>Section 15.

be issued for the purpose of any particular project. Any resolution, providing for the issuance of revenue bonds under the provisions of this Act shall become effective immediately upon its passage and need not be published or posted, and any such resolution may be passed at any regular or special or adjourned meeting of the Authority by a majority of the quorum as in this Act provided.</p><p><b>Section 17. Credit not Pledged</b>Revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this Act shall not be deemed to constitute a debt of Jackson County, or any municipality therein, but such bonds shall be payable solely from the fund hereinafter provided for and the issuance of such revenue bonds shall not be directly, indirectly or contingently obligate the said county, or any municipality therein, to levy or to pledge any form of taxation whatever therefor or to make any appropriation for the payment, and all such bonds shall contain recitals on their face covering substantially the foregoing provisions of this section.</p><p><b>Section 18. Trust Indenture as Security</b>In the discretion of the Authority, any issue of such revenue bonds may be secured by a trust indenture by and between the Authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or outside of the State. Such trust indenture may pledge or assign fees, tolls, revenues, and earnings to be received by the Authority, including the proceeds derived from the sale from time to time of any surplus property of the Authority, both real and personal. Either the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or such trust indenture may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the Authority in relation to the acquisition of property, the construction of the project, the maintenance, operation repair and insurance of the property, and the custody, safeguarding and application of all monies, including the proceeds derived from the sale of property of the Authority, both real and personal, and may also provide that any project shall be constructed and paid for under the supervision

It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of this State to act as such depository and to furnish such indemnifying bonds or pledge such securities as may be required by the Authority. Such indenture may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee, and may restrict the individual right of action of bondholders as is customary in trust indentures securing bonds and debentures of corporations. In addition to the foregoing, such trust indentures may contain such other provisions as the Authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust indenture may be treated as a part of the cost of maintenance, operation and repair of the project affected by such indenture.</p><p><b>Section 19. To Whom Proceeds of Bonds Shall be Paid</b>The Authority shall, in the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or in trust indenture, provide for the payment of the proceeds of the sale of the bonds to any officer or person who, or any agency, bank or trust company which, shall act as trustee of such funds and shall hold and apply the same to the purposes hereof, subject to such regulations as this Act and such resolutions or trust indentures may provide.</p><p><b>Section 20.

The use and disposition of such sinking fund shall be subject to such regulations as may be provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the revenue bonds or in the trust indenture, but, except as may otherwise be provided in such resolution or trust indenture, such sinking fund shall be a fund for the benefit of all revenue bonds without distinction or priority of one over another. Subject to the provisions of the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust indenture surplus monies in the sinking fund may be applied to the purchase or redemption of bonds and any such bonds so purchased or redeemed shall forthwith be cancelled and shall not again be issued.</p><p><b>Section 21.
