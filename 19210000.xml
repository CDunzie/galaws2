<page id="GA1921.1.P156" no="GA1921.1.160" />

Sound; thereby making it possible to transport on barges through a protected water route the products of the country drained by such rivers, and to deliver these products at the Atlantic seaboard, where the best markets are available; and</p><p>Whereas, The construction of the proposed canal and the opening up of the inland waterway by so supplying a connecting trunk line of protected water transportation to the seaboard, will bring into actual use and will develop the water transportation of the Mississippi River and of the other rivers east of the Mississippi flowing into the Gulf of Mexico; and thereby will make it possible to utilize for freight transportation over fifteen thousand miles of navigable streams draining the central and southeastern sections of the United States; and</p><p>Whereas, Such a water system of transportation will largely solve the transportation problems of the Mississippi Valley and of the southeastern section of the United States; will greatly aid the agricultural and industrial activities in said section by furnishing them perpetual and cheap transportation to the seaboard, where the best markets are located; will enhance the value of farm lands through the provision of means for delivering their products to markets; will furnish a perpetual avenue of transportation of practically unlimited capacity for such products; will, through water competition, insure low freight rates by rail for the products of that section to Atlantic ports; and will benefit a large section of the United States in greater degree than could be accomplished by the construction of thousands of miles of railroads throughout the section with their heavy maintenance and interest charges; and</p><p>Whereas, The building of such canal will greatly simplify the question of national defense; will create a short cut between the Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico, thereby

<page id="GA1921.1.P157" no="GA1921.1.161" />

eliminating nearly five hundred miles of distance by the water route between New Orleans and the Gulf ports, on the one hand, and New York and Liverpool, on the other, with a similar saving of distance as between the Gulf ports and other Atlantic seaboard and European ports; and will eliminate the dangers to shipping incident to the passage of the Straits of Florida, with consequent reduction of marine insurance, with a saving in time, and with reduced cost for the delivery of the products of the sections served to the markets of the world; and</p><p>Whereas, The construction of the said canal and the opening up of said inland waterways will not only materially benefit the State of Georgia and Florida, but will offer material benefits and advantages to fully onehalf of the producing area of the United States, and will form an essential link in the system of inland waterways to the construction of which the Federal Government is already committed; and</p><p>Whereas, The route for a lock-barge canal between Cumberland Sound and the Gulf of Mexico was surveyed and reported on by engineers for the Federal Government in 1876 and in 1880, which survey and report show that a lock-barge canal or a lock-ship canal can be built at a reasonable cost, and that the construction of the same is feasible; and</p><p>Whereas, The requirements of modern commerce and the quick and easy transportation of the enormously increased volume of products, as well as the requirements of the national defense and the facilities necessary to the development of an American merchant marine, indicate that such a canal should be constructed as a sealevel canal, rather than as a lock canal; and</p><p>Whereas, The Committee on Railways and Canals of the National House of Representatives, Sixty-sixth Congress, third session, in Report No. 1246, made on January

27, 1921, recommended an appropriation by Congress of fifty thousand dollars for the purpose of surveying and reporting on the feasibility and cost of such a canal and waterway; and</p><p>Whereas, It is desirable that public attention be called to the advantages of the construction of the proposed canal and waterway as a national asset; that public interest be enlisted in urging upon Congress its early survey and construction; that the matter be actively and aggressively presented to and urged upon Congress and the Federal authorities; and that some permanent body be created to take charge of and direct this effort; and</p><p>Whereas, The State of Georgia is the owner of valuable wharf property abutting on and adjacent to Cumberland Sound and its tributaries, where the terminus of such canal would be located; and it is desirable that the State be fully informed as to the best way to utilize this property for the benefit of its citizens and in aid of the promotion of this project; and</p><p>Whereas, It is probable that the State of Georgia can materially promote and aid in securing the construction of the said canal and waterway by arranging for the proper development of terminal facilities, wharves and docks upon its said property located on Cumberland Sound, so as to accommodate the shipping which will necessarily utilize such Sound, if and when the canal and waterway are completed; and, to that end, it is desirable that the Legislature of Georgia be fully advised of what property the State owns at or near Cumberland Sound, and of what is the best plan of development; and</p><p>Whereas, It is desirable that the Legislature of the other States tributary to the Gulf and to the Mississippi, and other rivers flowing into the Gulf, be asked to co-operate in the effort to secure the early construction of the said canal and waterways; and that they appoint suitable

<page id="GA1921.1.P159" no="GA1921.1.163" />

State Commissioners or Boards to represent the interests of their States in the effort to secure such early construction; and</p><p>Whereas, It is proper that the State of Georgia, through which a portion of said canal will run, and in whose waters its Atlantic terminus will be located, should take the initiative in the effort to secure the early construction of the canal and waterway; and should present its advantages to the other interested States and urge their co-operation in the effort to secure its construction by the Federal Government; and</p><p>Whereas, It is desirable that the possibilities of development and utilization of the State's valuable water-front property on Cumberland Sound be thoroughly investigated independently of said proposed canal and that the development of the State's entire waterway system be thoroughly and constantly kept before the public and recommendations made from time to time as to the uses to which the water power of the State may be put and of the water routes most desirable for commerce:</p><p>Now, therefore, be it enacted by the Legislature of Georgia:</p><p><list><item><p>First, That there is hereby created a permanent Commission to be known as the Georgia State Canal and Waterway Commission. <sidenote>Commission created.</sidenote></p></item><item><p>Second, The said Commission shall consist of three members, all of whom shall be citizens of the State of Georgia.
