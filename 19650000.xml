The territory comprising the counties of Fulton, DeKalb, Cobb, Clayton, and Gwinnett, including the City of Atlanta, has developed, and continues to develop, phenomenally into a metropolitan area with a common interest in the cultural, social and economic well-being of the people therein and the development of the educational, commercial and industrial resources thereof. There exists in this metropolitan area serious traffic conditions and congestions and serious mass transportation problems which impede, and will increasingly impede, the development of these common interests toward their fullest potential. Concerted governmental action is needed to alleviate such traffic conditions and congestion, supply deficiencies in mass transportation, coordinate and balance the transportation facilities operating therein, and otherwise provide a sounder basis for the development of traffic patterns and control. The development of a rapid transit system through a joint instrumentality of the local governments within the metropolitan area is a reasonable approach to the aforesaid needs and problems. The cultural, social and economic well-being of the people in the metropolitan area and the development of the educational, commercial, and industrial resources thereof are matters of public interest and concern throughout

the State. Accordingly, it is the public policy of this State, as a matter of public health, safety, convenience and welfare, to promote the establishment of such a joint instrumentality, encourage participation therein by the local governments involved, facilitate the accomplishment of its purposes and bring about solutions for the aforesaid needs and problems.</p><p><b>Section 4.

by this Act. In the discretion of the Board, bonds of a single issue may be issued for the purpose of a particular rapid transit project. Any resolution authorizing the issuance of bonds under the provisions of this Act may be made effective immediately upon its passage and need not be published or posted, and any such resolution may be passed at any regular or special meeting of the Board. However, the by-laws of the Board shall provide for advance written notice to members of the Board of any proposed resolution for the issuance of any bonds hereunder and for waivers thereof before action thereon.</p></item><item><p>(c) The principal of and interest on such bonds shall be payable solely from the special debt retirement fund hereinafter established for this purpose in subsection (m) hereof.</p></item><item><p>(d) The bonds of each issue shall be dated, shall bear interest payable semi-annually at a rate not exceeding six percent per annum, and shall mature in such amounts and at such times as the Board may deem appropriate but not exceeding forty years from the date thereof. The bonds may be in coupon or registered form, or both, as the Board may determine, and the Board may make provision for the registration of any coupon bond as to principal alone and also as to both principal and interest.</p></item><item><p>(e) The Board may prescribe the form of the bonds and any coupons which may be used in conjunction therewith; it may determine the denominations of the bonds, the terms and conditions of their redemption before maturity, the medium of payment both as to principal and interest and the place of payment of principal and interest, which may be at any bank or trust company within or without the State.</p></item><item><p>(f) All such bonds shall bear the manual or facsimile signature of the chairman or vice-chairman of the Board, attested by the secretary or treasurer thereof, and bear the official seal of the Authority. Any coupons attached thereto shall bear the facsimile signature of the secretary or treasurer of the Board. When bonds or coupons bear the manual or facsimile signature of an officer of the Authority,

such signature shall remain valid and effective for its original intent and purpose notwithstanding that prior to delivery the signer thereof may have ceased to hold the office indicated.</p></item><item><p>(g) All bonds issued under the provisions of this Act shall have and are hereby declared to have all the qualities and incidents of negotiable instruments under the laws of this State. Such bonds are hereby declared to be issued for an essential public and governmental purpose, and said bonds and the interest thereon shall be exempt from all taxation within the State.</p></item><item><p>(h) All bonds of the Authority shall be sold by public competitive bidding at par plus accrued interest to the date of delivery; provided, however, the Authority may obligate itself to deliver any given issue of bonds to the purchasers thereof within any reasonable period of time after the date of sale and may pay as a penalty for delay in such delivery such reasonable sums as may be agreed upon in advance in writing with the purchaser or purchasers of such bonds. All bonds of the Authority shall be advertised and offered prior to the fixing of the interest rates thereon, and bids thereon shall be competitive as to the interest rate offered by each bidder; provided, on any issue the Authority may make rules limiting the number of divisions into which the bonds of various maturity dates may be divided, and the number and percentage spreads of the different interest rates which may be bid to apply such divisions of the bonds and provided further, the Authority may require reasonable security for the performance of the contract of purchase of any successful bidder at any public competitive bidding held. The advertising of bond issues of the Authority and invitations to bid shall be as customarily done in the handling of governmental bond issues and section 14(b) as to these matters shall not necessarily apply. The Authority may negotiate the sale of its bonds to the Federal Government.</p></item><item><p>(i) The proceeds of such bonds shall be used solely for the payment of the cost of a rapid transit project or rapid transit projects. If the proceeds of a bond issue are not

<page id="GA1965.2.P261" no="GA1965.2.2261" />

sufficient to cover the cost thereof, unless otherwise provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds, or in any trust indenture pertaining thereto, additional bonds may in like manner be issued to provide the amount of the deficiency. Unless otherwise provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds, or in any trust indenture pertaining thereto, such additional bonds shall be deemed to be of the same issue and to be paid from the same fund, without preference or priority, as the bonds first issued for the same purpose. If the proceeds of the bonds of any issue shall exceed the amount required for the purpose for which such bonds were originally issued, the surplus shall be paid into such fund as may be provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in any trust indenture pertaining thereto or at the specific direction of the Board may be used for any other rapid transit project or projects.</p></item><item><p>(j) Prior to the preparation of definitive bonds the Board may issue interim receipts, interim certificates, or temporary bonds exchangeable for definitive bonds upon the issuance of the latter.</p></item><item><p>(k) In the discretion of the Board any issue of such revenue bonds may be secured by a trust indenture by and between the Authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without the State. Such trust indenture may pledge or assign fares, fees, rentals, charges, revenues and earnings of the Authority, including the proceeds derived from the sale of any surplus property of the Authority. Either the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or any trust indenture pertaining thereto may contain reasonable provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders, including covenants concerning the duties of the Authority in relation to the acquisition of property, the construction of the project, the maintenance, operation, repair and insurance of the property, and the custody, safeguarding and application of all monies, including the proceeds derived from the sale of property of the Authority, both real and personal, and may also provide that any project shall be constructed and paid

It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of this State to act as such depository and to furnish such indemnifying bonds or pledge such securities as may be required by the Board. Such indenture may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee, and may restrict the individual right of action of bondholders as is customary in trust indentures securing bonds and debentures of corporations. In addition to the foregoing, such trust indenture may contain such other provisions as the Board may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust indenture may be treated as a part of the cost of maintenance, operation and repair of the project affected by such indenture.</p></item><item><p>(l) The Board shall, in the resolution authorizing the issuance of bonds or in any trust indenture pertaining thereto, provide for the payment of the proceeds of the sale of the bonds to any bank or trust company which, shall act as trustee of such funds and shall hold and apply the same to the purposes hereof, subject to such regulations as this Act and such resolution or trust indenture may provide.</p></item><item><p>(m) The fares, fees, rentals, charges, revenues, and earnings of the Authority, monies derived from the sale of any surplus property of the Authority, and gifts, grants, and contributions from any source whatever, unless otherwise pledged and allocated, may be pledged and allocated by the Board to the payment of the principal of and interest on bonds of the Authority as the resolution authorizing the issuance of bonds, or any trust instrument pertaining thereto, may provide, and such funds so pledged, from whatever source received, including funds received from one or more or all sources, shall be set aside at regular intervals as may

The use and disposition of such special debt retirement fund shall be subject to such regulations as may be provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in any trust indenture, pertaining thereto, but, except as may otherwise be provided in such resolution or trust indenture, such fund shall be for the benefit of all bonds without distinction or priority of one over another. Subject to the provisions of the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in any trust indenture, surplus monies in the special debt retirement fund may be applied to the purchase or redemption of bonds and any such bonds so purchased or redeemed shall forthwith be cancelled and shall not again be issued.</p></item><item><p>(n) Any holder of bonds issued under the provisions of this Act or any of the coupons appertaining thereto, and the trustee under the trust indenture, if any, except to the extent the rights herein given may be restricted by resolution passed before the issuance of the bonds or by any trust indenture, may, either at law or in equity, by suit, action, mandamus, or other proceedings, protect and enforce any and all rights under the laws of the State of Georgia or granted hereunder or under such resolution or trust indenture, and may enforce and compel performance, of all duties required by this Act or by such resolution or trust indenture, to be performed by the Authority, or any officer thereof, including the fixing, charging and collecting of fares, fees, rentals, revenues, and other charges for the use of the facilities and services furnished and, in the event of a default of the Authority upon the principal and interest obligations of any bond issue, shall be subrogated to each and every right, specifically including the contract rights of collecting fares, fees, rentals, revenues and other charges against the City of Atlanta and the counties of Fulton, DeKalb, Cobb, Clayton and Gwinnett.</p></item>

the negotiation, determination and proposed rapid transit contract contemplated under this subsection shall not be construed to constitute a final contract or obligation, but the final execution of a rapid transit contract shall be completed in every instance in the manner contemplated in subsections (c), (d), (e), or (h) hereof.</p><p>(c) As a method of financing the participation required of it, in its entirety or any part thereof, under such a proposed rapid transit contract, a local government may, in the manner prescribed by law and subject to the limitations prescribed by law, issue general obligation bonds, pay over the proceeds thereof to the Authority and thereby complete the execution of the proposed rapid transit contract under which the Authority shall agree to perform for it the aforesaid governmental function and provide the necessary transportation services and facilities.</p><p>(d) As an alternative method of financing the participation required of it under such a proposed rapid transit contract, a local government may contract with the Authority by which the Authority may perform for such local government the aforesaid governmental function and obligate itself to pay on a periodic basis for the public transportation services and facilities contracted for, including the payment of the principal of, and interest on, any obligations issued by the Authority for the purpose of financing the cost of any rapid transit project or projects and this may include amounts necessary to establish and maintain reasonable reserves in connection therewith.</p><p>(e) When there is a proposed rapid transit contract to be executed between the Authority and a local government under subsection (d), the local governing body may proceed on its own resolution to complete the execution of the contract if it determines that the participation required thereunder may reasonably be financed without the levy of any new or increased tax on the property situated within its territory. In this event, the resolution of the local governing body that the participation required thereunder may reasonably be financed without the levy of any new or increased tax on the property situated within its territory

shall be conclusive of that fact. The Authority under this subsection shall be subject to and limited by any local act heretofore or hereafter enacted, more particularly applicable to the local governing body of any local government.</p><p>(f) Otherwise when there is a proposed rapid transit contract to be executed between the Authority and a local government under subsection (d), the local governing body shall call an election and shall submit to the qualified voters thereof, in a referendum as hereinafter provided, the question whether or not the local government should so obligate itself to the extent of the dollar amount or amounts involved therein.</p><p>(g) The procedure for holding the referendum called for in subsection (f) shall be as follows: The local governing body shall cause to be published in a newspaper having general circulation throughout the territory of the local government involved, once each week for three weeks immediately preceding the week during which the referendum is to be held, a notice to the electors thereof that on the day named therein an election will be held to determine the question whether or not the local government shall obligate itself to the Authority to the extent of the dollar amount or amounts involved in the proposed rapid transit contract. Such notice shall specify the extent of the total dollar amount or amounts involved under the proposed rapid transit contract. Such special election shall be held at all the election districts within the territorial limits of the local government involved except that an election called by the local governing body of any county within the metropolitan area shall not be held in any part thereof which is within the territorial limits of the City of Atlanta. The ballot submitting the question shall be in a form determined by the local governing body, and the form of the ballot shall be published as a part of the aforesaid notice. Each election held under the provisions of this subsection (including one held within the territorial limits of the City of Atlanta) is hereby declared to be a county election and shall be governed by and conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Georgia Election Code. The board of registrars of each county shall provide the necessary lists for

conducting any such election held within its county. After consolidation, the ordinary shall transmit the returns of such an election to the local governing authority calling the election, or its delegate, who shall officially declare the result. The expense of such an election held within the territorial limits of the City of Atlanta shall be paid by the City of Atlanta.</p><p>(h) If a majority of those voting in said election vote in favor of the proposition submitted then the local governing body shall thereby be authorized to complete the execution of a rapid transit contract, or contracts, wherein the total dollar amounts thereof do not exceed the total dollar amounts involved in the proposition submitted.</p><p>(i) A local government may elect any method provided in this section to finance the participation required of it in whole or in part, and the election of one method shall not preclude the election of another method with respect thereto or with respect to any additional or supplementary participation determined to be necessary.</p><p>(j) When the Authority and a local government have completed the execution of a rapid transit contract in full compliance with the requirements of this Act, such contract shall constitute an obligation on the part of the local government for the payment of which its good faith and credit are pledged, but on no other way can the good faith and credit of any local government be pledged with respect to a rapid transit contract.</p><p>(k) Any local government may use public funds to provide for a rapid transit system within the metropolitan area and may levy any taxes authorized to it by law to the extent necessary to fulfill the obligations incurred in contracts with the Authority; provided that no local county government shall have the power to levy any tax on any subject of taxation situated within the territorial limits of the City of Atlanta when the City of Atlanta has a contract with the Authority and is itself using its public funds or levying a tax for that purpose.</p><p>(l) Any local government may transfer to the Authority any property or facilities, or render any services, with or
