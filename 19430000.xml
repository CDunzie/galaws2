We find a

number of wardens who say that no rules have ever been issued by those in authority for methods of punishment or the general conduct at the highway camps. * * * We find a total absence of companionship and understanding between some of the officials and their prisoners. We find that some of the wardens and guards have the idea that the only way to control human beings confined to the chain gang is through inhumane and cruel methods of punishment; and</p><p>WHEREAS, The Committee aforesaid recommends many reforms, and concludes with the recommendation that unless the State Board of Prisons inaugurates such reforms, that I, as Governor, take such steps as may be necessary to carry out the recommendations made; and</p><p>WHEREAS, A report of the Penitentiary Committee of the Georgia House of Representatives has been filed with me in which it is set forth: We find much evidence of cruel and inhuman treatment of prisoners. * * * We find in many instances that such treatment of prisoners has definitely proven injurious to the prisoners' health and is certainly not conducive to the purpose of rehabilitation; and</p><p>WHEREAS, The committee aforesaid recommended many reforms and states: * * * after careful and studied analysis * * * based on our investigation, we believe the first difficulty in connection with the administration of penal affairs in the State is the result of an almost complete lack of intelligent direction, therefore, our studied conclusions in the matter are that there should first be appointed a competent Director of penal affairs with power to act, and that such Director should have full and complete control of Tattnall Prison and all State prisons; and</p><p>WHEREAS, The committee aforesaid concludes its recommendations in the following language: We further recommend that the Governor, in his discretion, take such steps as are deemed necessary in order to bring about the correction of the present system, keeping in mind the recommendations of this committee; and</p><p>WHEREAS, The Honorable Frank Gross, President of the Georgia State Senate, and the Honorable Roy V. Harris, Speaker of the House of Representatives of the State of Georgia, have filed with me a full and complete report of prison conditions in this State, and have compared conditions in this State with those of other States, and have recommended to me that the State Board of Prisons be abolished, that the office of Director of the Department of Corrections be created, and that a Director be named who will aid instead of hindering the rehabilitation of fallen mankind, and who will at the same time inaugurate a plan and policy of making the State's penal institutions self-supporting; and</p><p>WHEREAS, For many years the State of Georgia has maintained and operated a primitive, inhumane, cruel and archaic prison system, and by reason thereof the State of Georgia has received much criticism and adverse publicity, for the maintenance of such a prison system; and</p><p>WHEREAS, There is a compelling need and opportunity for a genuine public service in the rehabilitation of those convicted of crime in the establishment of a progressive, economical, modern and humane prison system in this State;</p><p>NOW, THEREFORE, Pursuant to the recommendation of the Honorable Frank Gross, President of the State Senate, and the Honorable Roy V.

<p>The President appointed on the part of the Senate Senators Kennedy of the 2nd, Forrester of the 44th.</p><p>At this time the President and Secretary, accompanied by the Senators, repaired to the hall of the House of Representatives to hear an address from His Excellency, Governor Ellis Arnall.</p><p>The joint session was called to order by Senate President Frank Gross.</p><p>The resolution convening the joint session was read by the secretary.</p><p>The following address was delivered by the Governor:</p><pre>MR. PRESIDENT, MR. SPEAKER,<br>AND MEMBERS OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY:<br /></br></pre><p>Georgia has a pressing problem. The problem is that of its penal system, which has caused for many years much worry to our citizens and to the State Government and which ras resulted in widespread criticism of Georgia throughout the nation. I do not doubt that much of the criticism has been nothing more than sensationalism; but however exaggerated some statements have been, the fact remains that all Georgians know that the penal system is punitive in purpose, archaic in method and unnecessarily costly to our taxpayers.</p><p>Three reports have been placed in my hands upon the Georgia penal system. One is by Senate committee, one by the House committee and one by the presiding officers of these two bodies. These reports, while treating different phases of the penal system, agree completely in one thing: that reformation and reorganization is necessary.</p><p>I am profoundly grateful to the Senate and House committees and to the presiding officers for their diligent and searching inquiries, and I believe that the citizens of our State are grateful to them for revealing these conditions.</p><p>In a democracy, there is but one way to proceed with such reforms. That method is the method prescribed by the constitution and laws of the State. An usurpation of power is no less an invasion of the rights of the citizens because the Executive believes sincerely that it is in the interest of the commonwealth. Well-intentioned tyranny is not less tyrannical because of the sincerity of the tyrant.</p><p>Accordingly, upon receiving the three reports from representatives of the legislative branch of our government and after studying them with very great care, I consulted with three elective officials, who, under our present law, are charged with administration of the penal system of Georgia. In addition, after preparing an outline of the reforms that appeared most imperative, I consulted with the Attorney General, representing the judicial branch of our government, and obtained from him his opinion.</p><p>The members of the State Board of Prisons were most cooperative in their attitude. They acknowledged readily that conditions in our penal system were unsatisfactory. They agreed with me upon the reforms that were needed most urgently.</p>

<p>However, these reforms could not be made under the existing laws of Georgia, because the most urgently needed reform, that providing for centralized direction and coordinatiaon of the penal system, could not be delegated by the Board. This ruling, by the Attorney General, following the established judicial precedents, left but two alternatives.</p><p>Either the Governor of Georgia would have to proceed, by Executive Order, in a manner I do not deem compatible with constitutional practices, or the Legislature would have to be called into session to consider the problem, to debate it, and to enact some measure dealing with it.</p><p>Therefore, deeply as I regret the inconvenience imposed upon the members in asking you to assemble on short notice at this season of the year, I issued a call for an extraordinary session of the General Assembly of Georgia, so that the legislative representatives of the people of this State may hear the reports of the committees from the Senate and House and act upon the need of Georgia for a correctional system adapted to our great State.</p><p>If we are to preserve our democratic principles of representative government, if we are to give to the world a demonstration that our democratic institutions are as virile today as when this republic was founded, it is essential that consideration of grave questions of policy, involving the responsibilities of elective officials, involving the lives and liberties of citizens of this State, and involving the large investment of the State and its subdivisions in the physical assets of the penal system, should be referred to the chosen representatives of the people of Georgia.</p><p>I recognize that there will be a few professional politicians who will seek to make political capital out of my summonsing of the Assembly into extraordinary session and who will assert that the cost of this session is needless. In my judgment, these reforms are urgent. In my judgment, the only lawful manner in which these reforms can be obtained is through calling the legislators to convene. In my judgment, the cost of the session is not a considerable item in Georgia's total budget, but if it were a substantial item, I would feel that the Assembly should be called, for human rights and human needs are above budgets and the obligation to protect citizens of the State and their rights has precedence over saving a sum of money.</p><p>The function of a prison system is to rehabilitate and train those whose conduct has marked them as dangerous to society. It should be the aim of a good penal institution to cause the prisoners to become useful, self-sustaining, fully employed, law-abiding citizens of our Sttae, able to take their places among their fellows.</p><p>A prison, of course, is not a vacation resort, nor should harmony within its walls be obtained by breaking down discipline. Firmness is necessary, but brutality is no substitute for firmness, and merciless severity is less effective than humane consideration in dealing with any man or woman.</p><p>Manifestly, such a humane system, such as is required by the Bill of Rights of our State and Federal constitutions, is not being practiced when prisoners are beaten and starved and manacled and chained. The lash, the sweat-box, the stocks, the leg-picks, the ball and chain, the shacklethese are not the means by which men can be brought to an understanding of society's solicitude for them. I am somewhat

skeptical about applying a horsewhip to a fourteen-year-old boy as a method of making him love his fellow-man and practice the Golden Rule.</p><p>Much of the crime in Georgia is caused by vocational ineptitude. The boy who has no trade, who does no job well, is very likely to get into trouble. It seems to me that it would be not only practicing Christian humanity but practicing realistic economy to teach such a boy to be a useful, self-supporting citizen than to make him into a confirmed criminal, hardened of heart, full of malice against mankind, possessed of the fury of a mad dog against his fellows, waiting only to kill or to be killed.</p><p>Let me cite you the Senate committee's report upon the conditions at one of the State camps: We find acts of cruelty at this camp in the whipping and beating of prisoners. As for example, the assistant warden admitted that an ignorant white boy was sent a pair of pajamas by his poverty-stricken relatives and on the night after receiving them he put these pajamas on to sleep in them, when it was a rule that they should sleep in prison night gowns. The assistant warden learning that the prisoner was wearing the simple article sent him by his family took him out of bed and gave him a whipping. This exemplifies the kind of reasons and excuses found by some of the officials for whipping prisoners in Georgia.</p><p>Let me cite you a short statement from the report of the House committee: We found much evidence of cruel and inhuman treatment of prisoners on the part of certain wardens and guards such as the use of picks or leg irons, the use of sweat-boxes, together with mistreatment of prisoners by so-called walking bosses who resort to the use of clubs, sticks and other brutal means of punishment. We found in many instances that such treatment of prisoners had definitely proven injurious to the prisoners' health and was certainly not conducive to the purpose of rehabilitation.</p><p>Let me cite you a brief portion of the report made by President Frank Gross of the Senate and Speaker Roy Harris of the House, who, at my request and at their own expense, made a rapid but careful survey of the prisons of Georgia and of some of the other Southern states:</p><p><blockquote><p>In no other state did we find leg irons. In no other state did the prisoners complain of floggings and beatings. In no other state did we find the prisoners generally sullen, bad tempered and talking revolt. In Georgia alone we found no intelligent effort being made to rehabilitate the prisoners and to fit them to return to civil life. If the State does not make an intelligent effort to rehabilitate these men and women they will be criminals when they return to civil life and will finally wind up in the penitentiary again.</p></blockquote></p><p>These are the reports of the Senate and House committees and of the presiding officers of the General Assembly. These reports are available to you. You will find, as I did, that they are written in anything but a lurid manner, that they engage in no overemphasis of isolated examples, and that they are completely factual. I think you will find, as I did, that in their simple and matter-of-fact understatement they are powerful documents, stringent criticism of a condition that has become intolerable to the citizens of Georgia. I believe that you will desire that these conditions be corrected.</p>

<p>A this very moment upon seven seas and six continents, American youths will go out to die for the cause of human rights, in a mortal struggle against barbarism, whose symbol is the concentration camp and the lash. Our institutions of punishment and correction must not be allowed to become an American equivalent of the Nazi concentration camp.</p><p>I do not believe that these shameful conditions can be corrected by less than a complete reorganization of the penal system. There has been no true reform of that system since, almost a half century ago, Georgia ended the iniquitous sale of human beings under the guise of the lease system. It is the responsibility of the General Assembly to consider the needs of the correctional institutions and to formulate the kind of system that Georgia needs and that Georgians desire: a humane system of rehabilitation for these social misfits that will enable them to be restored to society as men and women, not wild beasts.</p><p>In considering such a system, acting in accordance with the request of the Senate committee and of the House committee, both of which requested that the Governor take some action in the matter, I consulted with the able presiding officers of the General Assembly, with those trained in penology, with educators who knew the field of adult rehabilitation and with the members of the Prison Board.</p><p>These are the basic recommendations that I have to make to the General Assembly for your consideration in development of legislation looking toward a solution of Georgia's prison problem.</p><p>First, that the existing prison system be disestablished and, instead, a co-ordinated system, covering all prisoners in the State, be adopted, and that this new system have as its head a single executive official, clothed with adequate power to make and enforce proper rules and regulations. For convenience, I refer to that officer as the Director of Corrections, although, of course, the Assembly may see fit to provide some other official name.</p><p>I have no selection of a Director of Corrections. It would be improper to do so before the Assembly enacts legislation, and it would be imprudent to make a choice before knowing the type of act the Assembly will adopt. I hope, after careful scrutiny of the ablest men available, to select the man best fitted for the difficult task to which he will be assigned.</p><p>I believe that as wide discretionary power should be given to this official as is compatible with sound practice, and that the General Assembly, after laying down sufficiently broad rules governing the treatment of prisoners, should leave the development of administrative practices to this official.</p><p>In the establishment of the department I do not recommend that the terms of office of the present Prison Board members be extinguished. It is quite probable that the General Assembly will desire that their services be retained in an advisory capacity. The members of the Board have cooperated very thoroughly in efforts to lay a foundation for a reformed and reorganized penal system, and I commend their attitude and appreciate their concurrence in these recommendations. But, even had their attitude been otherwise, it would not be appropriate nor in keeping with democratic traditions for me, as Governor of Georgia, to recommend to you that they be dismissed from posts to which they were elected by the people of our State.

<page id="GA1943.2.P18" no="GA1943.2.11" />

Their experience may well be utilized in effecting this reorganization, if the Assembly sees fit.</p><p>Second, I recommend that the General Assembly provide certain standards governing the treatment of prisoners, by prohibiting whipping and the use of shackles, manacles, leg irons and picks; by providing for a central receiving station for all prisoners, so that they may be properly classified and assigned for work; by providing for segregation of juveniles and first offenders from habitual criminals, and permitting the Director of Corrections to transfer juveniles to other correctional or educational institutions; by providing for proper supervision by the Director of Corrections under administrative regulations that he may adopt, of the county camps and jails and other penal institutions of the State.</p><p>In my judgment, in which the committees, the members of the Prison Board and President Gross and Speaker Harris concur, it would be desirable for the Director of Corrections to make provision for transfer of the women prisoners from Tattnall to another institution; for proper vocational training to be provided for all prisoners; for the manufacturing enterprises potential at Tattnall to be developed; for stripes to be eliminated, except as a disciplinary measure; for segregation of the mentally diseased and for treatment under proper hospital or clinical conditions of those ill of body. However, if sufficiently broad powers of administration are granted to the Director, these aspects of the reform can best be brought about in that way rather than through specific legislative enactment. It would be undesirable, I believe, to endeavor to freeze the pattern of our penal system, thereby inviting years from now a repetition of the very condition we now seek to end.</p><p>Manifestly, the reformation of the penal system will require more than weeks. It will take months stretching into years to adapt other States' experience to meet our needs, to test techniques and methods, to indoctrinate personnel in the spirit of this new endeavor. Not every administrative policy will be perfect on first trial, and we must provide elasticity to meet changes in condition. The mistakes of forty years cannot be corrected overnight, and the growth of the Georgia penal system into one possessing every element desired by our people will require time and patience.</p><p>I should like to return briefly for a discussion of some of the items that I have enumerated.</p><p>The elimination of corporal punishment, of chains and picks and leg irons, appears to me to do no more than carry out the obvious intent of our State Bill of Rights, prohibiting cruel and unusual punishments.</p><p>Obviously, if we are to segregate prisoners, we must establish some means of classifying them for segregation, and the Director of Corrections must be vested with authority to transfer juveniles from Tattnall to other institutions. Similarly, if we are to avoid bringing the entire penal system into disrepute through misdeeds of a few individual wardens, it will be necessary for the Director to have wide powers to regulate the conduct of county camps, jails and other institutions.</p><p>No group in Georgia appreciates more fully the need for prison reform than the wardens and county officers. This was evident in their unanimous action at their last convention, calling for drastic revision in our penal methods. There are many

<page id="GA1943.2.P19" no="GA1943.2.12" />

excellent county camps and county penal systems in our State, with excellent and humane personnel, whose experience and sound viewpoint will make a valuable contribution in the readjustment of our system.</p><p>In considering the reforms that we must adopt in Georgia, we may well profit by the experience of other States. President Gross and Speaker Harris, in their report, disclose what has been done elsewhere in the south, under conditions that are comparable with the conditions here in Georgia. They found, for one thing, that idleness was the cause of much trouble in our institutions, and that the best institutions were those in which all prisoners were kept busy at something useful.</p><p>Men who are busy at something useful, who are well fed and well house and well clothed, do not break prison. The solution of escaped prisonersand escapes have been unusually frequent in Georgiais to provide useful employment and adequate, intelligent supervision.</p><p>We hope, I am sure, to build a penal system that will reform and reclaim men. Men are not reformed either by repression or by cruelty or by doing useless work. Men in prison still have self-respect. The correctional system should foster that self-respect. It is to be fostered best, it is generally agreed, by giving them useful things to do, rather than something to supposedly keep them busy. It is believed that a suitable educational-industrial-agricultural system would be almost self-sustaining, which the existing system is not, and that, in addition, the prisoners would find their morale improved by knowing that they were actually contributing something to the society they had wronged, rather than being mere objects for society's revenge.</p><p>It must be emphasized that there are two primary objectives in establishing prison industry: to provide work of a self-sustining nature for the prisoners and to train them for gainful employment when they are freed. The viewpoint of occupational education must be stressed above profit, and the system must not be permitted to deteriorate into one in which, for the sake of earning a surplus for the State, will compete with private industry and with free labor.</p><p>In the past, in Georgia, there has been much stressing of the economic value of the work done by convict labor. Careful examination will disclose that there has been no gain for the State, there has been no gain for the counties, nor for society as a whole, in the system, and that, instead, it has been very costly in terms of money. The use of prisoners to do by hand what can be done infinitely more efficiently by machines is economic waste.</p><p>But the economic side of the prison system need not be stressed unduly. Even if the chief function of the prison system were to make a profit, it is not performing that function: it operates at much greater cost than any comparable system elsewhere in the south. In addition, however, it functions to destroy lives, to wreck the future of men and women.</p><p>When I was driving about Georgia in the summer of 1942, a friend pointed out to me a large tract of land. If ever land had been blighted and destroyed in value, robbed of its richness, that land had been. It was stripped of topsoil, so that the red clay was disclosed. It was gullied and washed, so that the few saplings growing upon it were twisted and warped. It grew no crops. It could hardly grow the hardiest

<page id="GA1943.2.P20" no="GA1943.2.13" />

and most persistent weed. That land was a relic, my friend told me, of the convict lease system. The man who had owned it died long ago. His estate vanished in litigation. Even the land was cursed by his misdeeds.</p><p>That picture has been in my mind ever since.</p><p>It is inescapable that if we destroy men, we destroy everything.</p><p>These men in prison have committed wrongs against society. They have killed, and stolen, and cheated. They have brought upon themselves the disapproval of their fellow citizens. They have been taken into custody and tried in our courts and judged guilty for their misdeeds and sent away to be taught that they must live in decent harmony with their fellow men. It is the intent of our people, as it is the letter and the spirit of our State law, that when they have reformed, they shall be set free, that they shall walk abroad like other men, breathing the air of freedom as do other men.</p><p>In the past we have denied them the treatment that any man must have. We have caged them like wild animals. We have let them thirst and hunger. We have beaten them. We have chained them. We have forged iron bands about their legs. We have denied them the very solace of the Christian religion, for when I took office as Governor of Georgia there was no full-time chaplain at the prison where more than a thousand Georgia men were expiating their crimes and seeking to be rebuilt into useful citizens.</p><p>I know that we live in a practical day. We hear a great deal of talk about being practical, being efficient, doing what is wise and prudent. I think it is high time that we talked some once again about doing what is right.</p><p>It is not right to shut a man like a mad dog in a cage and whip him with a rubber hose and work him as a brutal drayman might work a sick horse. And when I think of boys huddled with professional criminals obtaining no education and no religious instruction, I am disgusted and I know that you are; but when I think of menmen made in the image of the most high Goddying in prison without the consolation of a man of God at their side, I am heart-sick. These things must not continue in our State.</p><p>It is necessary, for the good name of this commonwealth which James Edward Oglethorpe founded, taking for a motto the words: Not for ourselves but for others, that we provide a system of prisons that will effect the reformation of those who are sent there by the justice of our State.</p><p>Because this necessity is pressing, I have asked the General Assembly to meet here to consider and discover a solution for our problem.</p><p>In these days, democracy is being tested. Its enemies, at home and abroad, assert that it has lost its vitality, that it has lost the broad human sympathy that marked its onward march a hundred and fifty years ago, that it has even lost its capacity to act.</p><p>Our prompt action to solve this problem will be one more proof that in Georgia, through the agencies of democratic government and through the methods provided in our constitution, we can make democratic government work.</p>

<p>This General Assembly, as I have said many times before, is the best, I believe, in Georgia's long history. The measures that were written into law in your session in January received overwhelming approval at the hands of your fellow citizens, an adequate proof that they agree with me that this body has served well and truly is representative of the people of our State.</p><p>In eliminating the evils of the prison system, which so long have been a reproach to Georgia in the eyes of the nation, the General Assembly, in my judgment, will have performed one more servicea service as great as that which liberated education from political interference.</p><p>In your efforts to bring about reform of our prison system and to make it an instrument for rehabilitating the unfortunate, you will have not only the complete cooperation of every agency at the disposal of the Executive Department of the State, but you will have the undivided support and the lasting appreciation of the people of Georgia.</p><p>Mr. Durden of Dougherty moved that the joint session be dissolved and the motion prevailed.</p><p>The Senate resumed its regular order of business.</p><p>Senator Atkinson of the 1st asked unanimous consent that when the Senate adjourn today it stand adjourned until 11:00 o'clock tomorrow morning and the consent was granted.</p><p>The following bills of the Senate were read the first time and referred to committees:</p><p>SB 1.

PRESIDENT AND SENATORS:</p><p>The General Assembly merited the appreciation of the citizens of Georgia, when, earlier this year, it liberated education from political tyranny, provided a retirement system for our teachers, granted the elective franchise to a large group of courageous young Georgians, and established firmly the doctrine of democratic processes in conducting the government of our State.</p><p>On the occasion of your adjournment of that session, I said to this Assembly that I believed it was the best in Georgia's long and honorable history.</p><p>Today I repeat that statement. While not adopting all of the suggestions I made to you, yet your accomplishment in this brief five day session will be historic.

<page id="GA1943.2.P38" no="GA1943.2.31" />

Once again you have given proof that democratic processes and constitutional methods are able to solve our problems; that democracies know how to act promptly; that the system of representative government is effective; that free discussion is a better remedy for public ills than peremptory orders backed by bayonets.</p><p>In providing a humane correctional system for fellow-Georgians who have wronged society, you have not only removed physical shackles from their limbs and fear of the lash from their hearts, but you have given them, instead of malice and hatred to mankind, a renewed faith in the decency and generosity of their fellow men and removed the shackles of spiritual hopelessness that degraded them. The degredation of any man is the degredation of every man; society has no right to practices that it would condemn with propriety in the individual.</p><p>The State of Georgia, so long maligned because of the infamy attached to its penal system, and every right thinking citizen of Georgia is grateful to the members of the General Assembly for a prompt and complete fulfillment of their duty, in a manner that can but add lustre to the name of our State as it attaches honor to your own.</p><pre>ELLIS ARNALL<br set="RIGHT"><i>Governor</i><br set="RIGHT">ea/gc<br /></br></br></pre><p>The following message was received from the House through Mr. McCutchen, the Clerk thereof:</p><p>Mr. President:</p><p>The House has passed by the requisite constitutional majority the following resolutions of the House to wit:</p><p>HR 13.

Arnall, the House met in extraordinary session this day at 10:00 o'clock A. M., and was called to order by the Honorable Roy V. Harris, Speaker.</p><p>The following proclamation calling the General Assembly in extraordinary session was read:</p><div><title>A PROCLAMATION<br set="CENTER">CONVENING THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF GEORGIA<br set="CENTER">IN EXTRAORDINARY SESSION<br set="CENTER" /></br></br></title><p>WHEREAS, Under the laws of Georgia it is declared to be the duty of the State Board of Prisons to have complete management and control of the State convicts; that they shall regulate the hours of their labor, the manner and extent of their punishment, the variety and quantity of their food, the kind and character of their clothing; and shall make such other rules and regulations as will assure their safekeeping and proper care; and</p><p>WHEREAS, There has been filed with me a report of the Penitentiary Committee of the Georgia State Senate, in which it is set forth: We find that the food is totally inadequate to the needs of human beings while performing hard labors, and many prisoners show by their faces that they are undernourished. We find a number of wardens who say that no rules have ever been issued by those in authority for methods of punishment or the general conduct at the highway camps.... We find a total absence of companionship and understanding between some of the officials and their prisoners. We find that some of the wardens and guards have the idea that the osly way to control human beings confined to the echain gang is through inhumane and cruel punishment; and</p><p>WHEREAS, The Committee aforesaid recommends many reforms, and concludes with the recommendation that unless the State Board of Prisons inaugurates such reforms, that I, as Governor, take such steps as may be necessary to carry out the recommendations made; and</p><p>WHEREAS, A report of the Penitentiary Committee of the Georgia House of Representatives has been filed with me in which it is set forth: We find much evidence of cruel and inhuman treatment of prisoners... We find in many instances that such treatment of prisoners has definitely proven injurious to the prisoners' health and is certainly not conducive to the purpose of rehabilitation; and</p><p>WHEREAS, The committee aforesaid recommended many reforms and states: ... after a careful and studied analysis... based on our investigation, we believe the first difficulty in connection with the administration of penal affairs in the State is the result of an almost complete lack of intelligent direction, therefore, our studied conclusions in the matter are that there should first be appointed a competent Director of penal affairs with power to act, and that such Director should have full and complete control of Tattnall Prison and all State prisons; and</p>

<page id="GA1943.2.P46" no="GA1943.2.4" />

<p>WHEREAS, The committee aforesaid concludes its recommendations in the following language: We further recommend that the Governor, in his discretion, take such steps as are deemed necessary in order to bring about the correction of the present system, keeping in mind the recommendations of this committee; and</p><p>WHEREAS, The Honorable Frank Gross, President of the Georgia State Senate, and the Honorable Roy V. Harris, Speaker of the House of Representatives of the State of Georgia, have filed with me a full and complete report of prison conditions in this State, and have compared conditions in this State with those of other States, and have recommended to me that the State Board of Prisons be abolished, that the office of Director of the Department of Corrections be created, and that a Director be named who will aid instead of hindering the rehabilitation of fallen mankind, and who will at the same time inaugurate a plan and policy of making the State's penal institutions self-supporting; and</p><p>WHEREAS, For many years the State of Georgia has maintained and operated a primitive, inhumane, cruel and archaic prison system, and by reason thereof the State of Georgia has received much criticism and adverse publicity, for the maintenance of such a prison system; and</p><p>WHEREAS, There is a compelling need and opportunity for a genuine public service in the rehabilitation of those convicted of crime in the establishment of a progressive, economical, modern and humane prison system in this State;</p><p>NOW, THEREFORE, Pursuant to the recommendation of the Honorable Frank Gross, President of the State Senate, and the Honorable Roy V. Harris, Speaker of the Georgia House of Representatives, and the recommendation of the Penitentiary Committees of the Georgia State Senate and the House of Representatives, and under and by virtue of the power and authority conferred upon me by the Constitution of this State, as set forth in Article V, Section I, Paragraph XLII, I, Ellis G. Arnall, Governor of Georgia, do hereby convoke and call a meeting of the General Assembly of this State in Extraordinary Session at 10 o'clock A. M., Central War Time, on Monday, September 27, 1943, for the purpose of considering and enacting laws and resolutions, by revision, repeal, amendment or otherwise, relating to the following objectives, which are considered by me, as Chief Executive of this State, to be of sufficient importance to demand the necessity for such Extraordinary Session of the General Assembly of Georgia, to-wit:</p><p><list><item><p>(1) Legislation abolishing the State Board of Prisons and creating a Department, Board, and office of Director of Corrections and defining the terms, appointments, powers, duties and authority thereof.</p></item><item><p>(2) Legislation effectuating prison reforms.</p></item></list></p><p>Given under my hand and the Great Seal of the State of Georgia, at the City of Atlanta, on this the 25th day of September, Year of Our Lord One Thousand Nine Hundred and Forty-Three.</p><pre>ELLIS ARNALL,<br set="RIGHT"><i>Governor.</i><br set="RIGHT">By the Governor.<br>JOHN B.

(The President has appointed on the part of the Senate, Senators Kennedy of the 2nd, and Forrester of the 44th.)</p><p>The time of convening the joint session of the House and Senate having arrived, the Senate appeared upon the floor of the House and the joint session convened for the purpose of hearing a message from His Excellency, Governor Ellis G. Arnall, was called to order by Honorable Frank C. Gross, President of the Senate.</p><p>The Secretary of the Senate, Mrs. Henry W. Nevin, read the resolution providing for the joint session.</p><p>Accompanied by the Committee of Escort, Governor Arnall appeared upon the floor of the House and delivered the following address:</p><p>MR. PRESIDENT, MR. SPEAKER, AND MEMBERS OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY:</p><p>Georgia has a pressing problem. The problem is that of its penal system, which has caused for many years much worry to our citizens and to the State government and which has resulted in widespread criticism of Georgia throughout the nation. I do not doubt that much of the criticism has been nothing more than sensationalism; but however exaggerated some statements have been, the fact remains that all Georgians know that the penal system is punitive in purpose, archaic in method and unnecessarily costly to our taxpayers.</p>

<page id="GA1943.2.P50" no="GA1943.2.8" />

<p>Three reports have been placed in my hands upon the Georgia penal system. One is by Senate committee, one by the House committee and one by the presiding officers of these two bodies. These reports, while treating different phases of the penal system, agree completely in one thing; that reformation and reorganization is necessary.</p><p>I am profoundly grateful to the Senate and House committees and to the presiding officers for their diligent and searching inquiries, and I believe that the citizens of our State are grateful to them for revealing these conditions.</p><p>In a democracy, there is but one way to proceed with such reforms. That method is the method prescribed by the constitution and laws of the State. An usurpation of power is no less an invasion of the rights of the citizens because the Executive believes sincerely that it is in the interest of the commonwealth. Well-intentioned tyranny is not less tyrannical because of the sincerity of the tyrant.</p><p>Accordingly, upon receiving the three reports from representatives of the legislative branch of our government and after studying them with very great care, I consulted with three elective officials, who, under our present law, are charged with administration of the penal system of Georgia. In addition, after preparing an outline of the reforms that appeared most imperative, I consulted with the Attorney General, representing the judicial branch of our government, and obtained from him his opinion.</p><p>The members of the State Board of Prisons were most cooperative in their attitude. They acknowledged readily that conditions in our penal system were unsatisfactory. They agreed with me upon the reforms that were needed most urgently.</p><p>However, these reforms could not be made under the existing laws of Georgia, because the most urgently needed reform, that providing for centralized direction and coordination of the penal system, could not be delegated by the Board. This ruling, by the Attorney General, following the established judicial precedents, left but two alternatives.</p><p>Either the Governor of Georgia would have to proceed, by Executive Order, in a manner I do not deem compatible with constitutional practices, or the legislature would have to be called into session to consider the problem, to debate it, and to enact some measure dealing with it.</p><p>Therefore, deeply as I regret the inconvenience imposed upon the members in asking you to assemble on short notice at this season of the year, I issued a call for an extraordinary session of the General Assembly of Georgia, so that the elective legislative representatives of the people of this State may hear the reports of the committees from the Senate and House and act upon the need of Georgia for a correctional system adapted to our great State.</p><p>If we are to preserve our democratic principles of representative government, if we are to give to the world a demonstration that our democratic institutions are as virile today as when this republic was founded, it is essential that consideration of grave questions of policy, involving the responsibilities of elective officials, involving the lives and liberties of citizens of this State, and involving large investment of the State and its subdivisions in the physical assets of the penal system, should be referred to the chosen representatives of the people of Georgia.</p>

<page id="GA1943.2.P51" no="GA1943.2.9" />

<p>I recognize that there will be a few professional politicians who will seek to make political capital out of my summonsing of the Assembly into extraordinary session and who will assert that the cost of this session is needless. In my judgment, these reforms are urgent. In my judgment, the only lawful manner in which these reforms can be obtained is through calling the legislators to convene. In my judgment, the cost of the session is not a considerable item in Georgia's total budget, but if it were a substantial item, I would feel that the Assembly should be called, for human rights and human needs are above budgets and the obligation to protect citizens of the State and their rights has precedence over saving a sum of money.</p><p>The function of a prison system is to rehabilitate and train those whose conduct has marked them as dangerous to society. It should be the aim of a good penal institution to cause the prisoners to become useful, self-sustaining, fully employed, law-abiding citizens of our State, able to take their places among their fellows.</p><p>A prison, of course, is not a vacation resort, nor should harmony within its walls be obtained by breaking down discipline. Firmness is necessary, but brutality is no substitute for firmness, and merciless severity is less effective than humane consideration in dealing with any man or woman.</p><p>Manifestly, such a humane system, such as is required by the Bill of Rights of our State and Federal constitutions, is not being practiced when prisoners are beaten and starved and manacled and chained. The lash, the sweat-box, the stocks, the leg-picks, the ball and chain, the shacklethese are not the means by which men can be brought to an understanding of society's solicitude for them. I am somewhat skeptical about applying a horsewhip to a fourteen-year-old boy as a method of making him love his fellow-man and practice the Golden Rule.</p><p>Much of the crime in Georgia is caused by vocational ineptitude. The boy who has no trade, who does no job well, is very likely to get into trouble. It seems to me that it would be not only practicing Christian humanity but practicing realistic economy to teach such a boy to be a useful, self-supporting citizen than to make him into a confirmed criminal, hardened of heart, full of malice against mankind, possessed of the fury of a mad dog against his fellows, waiting only to kill or to be killed.</p><p>Let me cite you to the Senate committee's report upon the conditions at one of the State camps: We find acts of cruelty at this camp in the whipping and beating of prisoners. As for example, the assistant warden admitted that an ignorant white boy was sent a pair of pajamas by his poverty-stricken relatives and on the night after receiving them he put these pajamas on to sleep in them, when it was a rule that they should sleep in prison night gowns. The assistant warden learning that the prisoner was wearing the simple article sent him by his family took him out of bed and gave him a whipping. This exemplifies the kind of reasons and excuses found by some of the officials for whipping prisoners in Georgia.</p><p>Let me cite you a short statement from the report of the House committee: We found much evidence of cruel and inhuman treatment of prisoners on the part of certain wardens and guards such as the use of picks or leg irons, the use of sweat-boxes, together with mistreatment of prisoners by so-called walking bosses who resort to the use of clubs, sticks and other brutal means of punishment. We found

<page id="GA1943.2.P52" no="GA1943.2.10" />

in many instances that such treatment of prisoners had definitely proven unjurious to the prisoners' health and was certainly not conducive to the purpose of rehabilitation.</p><p>Let me cite you a brief portion of the report made by President Frank Gross of the Senate and Speaker Roy Harris of the House, who, at my request and at their own expense, made a rapid but careful survey of the prisons of Georgia and of some of the other Southern states:</p><p><blockquote><p>In no other state did we find leg irons. In no other state did the prisoners complain of floggings and beatings. In no other state did we find the prisoners generally sullen, bad tempered and talking of revolt. In Georgia alone we found no intelligent effort being made to rehabilitate the prisoners and to fit them to return to civil life. If the State does not make an intelligent effort to rehabilitate these men and women they will be criminals when they return to civil life and will finally wind up in the penitentiary again.</p></blockquote></p><p>These are the reports of the Senate and House committees and of the presiding officers of the General Assembly. These reports are available to you. You will find, as I did, that they are written in anything but a lurid manner, that they engage in no overemphasis of isolated examples, and that they are completely factual. I think you will find, as I did, that in their simple and matter-of-fact understatement they are powerful documents, stringent criticism of a condition that has become intolerable to the citizens of Georgia. I believe that you will desire that these conditions be corrected.</p><p>At this very moment upon seven seas and six continents, American youths will go out to die for the cause of human rights, in a mortal struggle against barbarism, whose symbol is the concentration camp and the lash. Our institutions of punishment and correction must not be allowed to become an American equivalent of the Nazi concentration camp.</p><p>I do not believe that these shameful conditions can be corrected by less than a complete reorganization of the penal system. There has been no true reform of that system since, almost a half century ago, Georgia ended the iniquitous sale of human beings under the guise of the lease system. It is the responsibility of the General Assembly to consider the needs of the correctional institutions and to formulate the kind of system that Georgia needs and that Georgians desire: a humane system of rehabilitation for these social misfits that will enable them to be restored to society as men and women, not wild beasts.</p><p>In considering such a system, acting in accordance with the request of the Senate committee and of the House committee, both of which requested that the Governor take some action in the matter, I consulted with the able presiding officers of the General Assembly, with those trained in penology, with educators who knew the field of adult rehabilitation and with the members of the Prison Board.</p><p>These are the basic recommendations that I have to make to the General Assembly for your consideration in development of legislation looking toward a solution of Georgia's prison problem.</p><p>First, that the existing prison system be disestablished and, instead, a coordinated system, covering all prisoners in the State, be adopted, and that this new

<page id="GA1943.2.P53" no="GA1943.2.11" />

system have as its head a single executive official, clothed with adequate power to make and enforce proper rules and regulations. For convenience, I refer to that officer as the Director of Corrections, although, of course, the Assembly may see fit to provide some other official name.</p><p>I have no selection of a Director of Corections. It would be improper to do so before the Assembly enacts legislation, and it would be imprudent to make a choice before knowing the type of act the Assembly will adopt. I hope, after careful scrutiny of the ablest men available, to select the man best fitted for the difficult task to which he will be assigned.</p><p>I believe that as wide discretionary power should be given to this official as is compatible with sound practice, and that the General Assembly, after laying down sufficiently broad rules governing the treatment of prisoners, should leave the development of administrative practices to this official.</p><p>In the establishment of the department I do not recommend that the terms of office of the present Prison Board members be extinguished. It is quite probable that the General Assembly will desire that their services be retained in an advisory capacity. The members of the Board have cooperated very thoroughly in efforts to lay a foundation for a reformed and reorganized penal system, and I commend their attitude and appreciate their concurrence in these recommendations. But, even had their attitude been otherwise, it would not be appropriate nor in keeping with democratic traditions for me, as Governor of Georgia, to recommend to you that they be dismissed from posts to which they were elected by the people of our State. Their experience may well be utilized in effecting this reorganization, if the Assembly sees fit.</p><p>Second, I recommend that the General Assembly provide certain standards governing the treatment of prisoners, by prohibiting whipping and the use of shackles, manacles, leg irons and picks; by providing for a central receiving station for all prisoners, so that they may be properly classified and assigned for work; by providing for segregation of juveniles and first offenders from habitual criminals, and permitting the Director of Corrections to transfer juveniles to other correctional or educational institutions; by providing for proper supervison by the Director of Corrections under administrative regulations that he may adopt, of the county camps and jails and other penal institutions of the State.</p><p>In my judgment, in which the committees, the members of the Prison Board and President Gross and Speaker Harris concur, it would be desirable for the Director of Corrections to make provision for transfer of the women prisoners from Tattnall to another institution; for proper vocational training to be provided for all prisoners; for the manufacturing enterprises potential at Tattnall to be developed; for stripes to be eliminated, except as a disciplinary measure; for segregation of the mentally diseased and for treatment under proper hospital or clinical conditions of those ill of body. However, if sufficiently broad powers of administration are granted to the Director, these aspects of the reform can best be brought about in that way rather than through specific legislative enactment. It would be undesirable, I believe, to endeavor to freeze the pattern of our penal system, thereby inviting years from now a repetition of the very condition we now seek to end.</p>

<page id="GA1943.2.P54" no="GA1943.2.12" />

<p>Manifestly, the reformation of the penal system will require more than weeks. It will take months stretching into years to adapt other States' experience to meet our needs, to test techniques and methods, to indoctrinate personnel in the spirit of this new endeavor. Not every administrative policy will be perfect on first trial, and we must provide elasticity to meet changes in condition. The mistakes of forty years cannot be corrected overnight, and the growth of the Georgia penal system into one possessing every element desired by our people will require time and patience.</p><p>I should like to return briefly for a discussion of some of the items that I have enumerated.</p><p>The elimination of corporal punishment, of chains and picks and leg irons, appears to me to do no more than carry out the obvious intent of our State Bill of Rights, prohibiting cruel and unusual punishments.</p><p>Obviously, if we are to segregate prisoners, we must establish some means of classifying them for segregation, and the Director of Corrections must be vested with authority to transfer juveniles from Tattnall to other institutions. Similarly, if we are to avoid bringing the entire penal system into disrepute through misdeeds of a few individual wardens, it will be necessary for the Director to have wide powers to regulate the conduct of county camps, jails and other institutions.</p><p>No group in Georgia appreciates more fully the need for prison reform than the wardens and county officers. This was evident in their unanimous action at their last convention, calling for drastic revision in our penal methods. There are many excellent county camps and county penal systems in our State, with excellent and humane personnel, whose experience and sound viewpoint will make a valuable contribution in the readjustment of our system.</p><p>In considering the reforms that we must adopt in Georgia, we may well profit by the experience of other States. President Gross and Speaker Harris, in their report, disclose what has been done elsewhere in the south, under conditions that are comparable with the conditions here in Georgia. They found, for one thing, that idleness was the cause of much trouble in our institutions, and that the best institutions were those in which all prisoners were kept busy at something useful.</p><p>Men who are busy at something useful, who are well fed and well housed and well clothed, do not break prison. The solution of escaped prisonersand escapes have been unusually frequent in Georgiais to provide useful employment and adequate, intelligent supervision.</p><p>We hope, I am sure, to build a penal system that will reform and reclaim men. Men are not reformed either by repression or by cruelty or by doing useless work. Men in prison still have self-respect. The correctional system should foster that self-respect. It is to be fostered best, it is generally agreed, by giving them useful things to do, rather than something to supposedly keep them busy. It is believed that a suitable educational-industrial-agricultural system would be almost self-sustaining, which the existing system is not, and that, in addition, the prisoners would find their morale improved by knowing that they were actually contributing something to the society they had wronged, rather than being mere objects for society's revenge.</p><p>It must be emphasized that there are two primary objectives in establishing prison industry: to provide work of a self-sustaining nature for the prisoners and to

<page id="GA1943.2.P55" no="GA1943.2.13" />

train them for gainful employment when they are freed. The viewpoint of occupational education must be stressed above profit, and the system must not be permitted to deteriorate into one in which, for the sake of earning a surplus for the State, will compete with private industry and with free labor.</p><p>In the past, in Georgia, there has been much stressing of the economic value of the work done by convict labor. Careful examination will disclose that there has been no gain for the State, there has been no gain for the counties, nor for society as a whole, in the system, and that, instead, it has been very costly in terms of money. The use of prisoners to do by hand what can be done infinitely more efficiently by machines is economic waste.</p><p>But the economic side of the prison system need not be stressed unduly. Even if the chief function of the prison system were to make a profit, it is not performing that function: it operates at much greater cost than any comparable system elsewhere in the south. In addition, however, it functions to destroy lives, to wreck the future of men and women.</p><p>When I was driving about Georgia in the summer of 1942, a friend pointed out to me a large tract of land. If ever land had been blighted and destroyed in value, robbed of its richness, that land had been. It was stripped of topsoil, so that the red clay was disclosed. It was gullied and washed, so that the few saplings growing upon it were twisted and warped. It grew no crops. It could hardly grow the hardiest and most persistent weed. That land was a relic, my friend told me, of the convict lease system. The man who had owned it died long ago. His estate vanished in litigation. Even the land was cursed by his misdeeds.</p><p>That picture has been in my mind ever since.</p><p>It is inescapable that if we destroy men, we destroy everything.</p><p>These men in prison have committed wrongs against society. They have killed, and stolen, and cheated. They have brought upon themselves the disapproval of their fellow citizens. They have been taken into custody and tried in our courts and judged guilty for their misdeeds and sent away to be taught that they must live in decent harmony with their fellow men. It is the intent of our people, as it is the letter and the spirit of our State law, that when they have reformed, they shall be set free, that they shall walk abroad like other men, breathing the air of freedom as do other men.</p><p>In the past we have denied them the treatment that any man must have. We have caged them like wild animals. We have let them thirst and hunger. We have beaten them. We have chained them. We have forged iron bands about their legs. We have denied them the very solace of the Christian religion, for when I took office as Governor of Georgia there was no full-time chaplain at the prison where more than a thousand Georgia men were expiating their crimes and seeking to be rebuilt into useful citizens.</p><p>I know that we live in a practical day. We hear a great deal of talk about being practical, being efficient, doing what is wise and prudent. I think it is high time that we talked some once again about doing what is right.</p>

<page id="GA1943.2.P56" no="GA1943.2.14" />

<p>It is not right to shut a man like a mad dog in a cage and whip him with a rubber hose and work him as a brutal drayman might work a sick horse. And when I think of boys huddled with professional criminals obtaining no education and no religious instruction, I am disgusted and I know that you are; but when I think of menmen made in the image of the most high Goddying in prison without the consolation of a man of God at their side, I am heart-sick. These things must not continue in our State.</p><p>It is necessary, for the good name of this commonwealth which James Edward Oglethorpe founded, taking for a motto the words: Not for ourselves but for others, that we provide a system of prisons that will effect the reformation of those who are sent there by the justice of our State.</p><p>Because this necessity is pressing, I have asked the General Assembly to meet here to consider and discover a solution for our problem.</p><p>In these days, democracy is being tested. Its enemies, at home and abroad, assert that it has lost its vitality, that it has lost the broad human sympathy that marked its onward march a hundred and fifty years ago, that it has even lost its capacity to act.</p><p>Our prompt action to solve this problem will be one more proof that in Georgia, through the agencies of democratic government and through the methods provided in our constitution, we can make democratic government work.</p><p>This General Assembly, as I have said many times before, is the best, I believe, in Georgia's long history. The measures that were written into law in your session in January received overwhelming approval at the hands of your fellow citizens, an adequate proof that they agree with me that this body has served well and truly is representative of the people of our State.</p><p>In eliminating the evils of the prison system, which so long have been a reproach to Georgia in the eyes of the nation, the General Assembly, in my judgment, will have performed one more servicea service as great as that which liberated education from political interference.</p><p>In your efforts to bring about reform of our prison system and to make it an instrument for rehabilitating the unfortunate, you will have not only the complete cooperation of every agency at the disposal of the Executive Department of the State, but you will have the undivided support and the lasting appreciation of the people of Georgia.</p><p>Mr. Durden of Dougherty moved that the joint session be now dissolved, and the motion prevailed.</p><p>By unanimous consent, the following was established as the order of business during the first part of the period of unanimous consents:</p><p>1.

The prison morale is better than it was. The buildings are cleaner and better operated. The Farm Superintendent has done a swell job in making a crop when he started from scratch on the first of April. The head of the prison industries is making a desperate effort to reclaim them. However, a lot of

<page id="GA1943.2.P63" no="GA1943.2.21" />

valuable and necessary machinery and equipment was disposed of during the years 1941 and 1942 and, without additional equipment, he is now almost helpless.</p><p>However, we found the worst system that we have seen anywhere.</p><p>In every prison that we have visited the buildings were cleaner, the clothing of the prisoners was cleaner, and the morale of the prisoners was better. All of the prisoners who were not in the hospital in every other prison were at work. They all appeared to be clean personally, to have on clean clothing and to be in a pleasant frame of mind.</p><p>In Tattnall we found them with dirty clothes, with ragged clothes and at least half of them idle and doing nothing. In Tattnall we found an Eight Ball Gang consisting of approximately twenty-five, wearing the most brutal leg irons to be imagined, complaining of being beaten and whipped almost daily, with an attitude of open defiance and threatening to strike and refuse to work.</p><p>We found more than sixteen young men, of ages ranging from seventeen to less than thirty, laying in the bed with their heel strings cut. Each of them stated that the reason they cut their heel strings was because of the cruelty which they suffered and that it was the only means of escape for a time. Prisoners openly told us that a general uprising was brewing among the prisoners.</p><p>In no other state did we find this condition. In no other state did we find leg irons. And, in no other state did the prisoners complain of floggings and beatings. In no other state did we find the prisoners generally sullen, bad tempered and talking of revolt.</p><p>In every other state we found the prisoners busy, we found them clean, in good health and with every appearance of being well fed and cared for.</p><p>In Georgia alone we found no intelligent effort being made to rehabilitate the prisoners and to fit them to return to civil life. This is especially bad in view of the fact that most of the inmates of the prison will automatically be returned to civil life some day at the expiration of the terms of their sentences. If the State does not make an intelligent effort to rehabilitate these men and women they will be criminals when they return to civil life and will finally wind up in the penitentiary again. The protection of the people of the State demands that something be done to try to rehabilitate these people.</p><p>At the same time we find our prison system very costly. In 1942 it cost the State $363,216.32 to support Tattnall, $60,785.54 for prison administration and $401,699.55 to support the State Highway camps.</p><p>In most of the States that we visited the prison industries and farms are so organized that they pay at least seventy-five (75%) per cent of the cost of operation. In some States they are entirely self-supporting and in Mississippi, through the coordination of the farm and prison industries the penal system paid into the State Treasury the sum of five hundred and forty thousand dollars in cash more than they took out for the last fiscal year.</p><p>In making our recommendations we have endeavored to the best of our ability to set forth in detail a plan designed to rehabilitate as many of the prisoners as

<page id="GA1943.2.P64" no="GA1943.2.22" />

possible and to fit them to return to civil life as useful and decent citizens and to make them self-supporting while they are inmates of the prison and wards of the State.</p><p>We recommend the following:</p><p>(1) Prison management. That the Prison Commission be abolished.</p><p>A regular feud has been going on among the members of the Commission for some time and they have been unable to cooperate with one another and coordinate their efforts.</p><p>Instead of the present Prison Commission we recommend that the office of Director of the Department of Corrections be created. In our investigation we found that the most successful States have only one official in charge and that he serves at the pleasure of the Governor.</p><p>We suggest the elimination of the name Prison for psychological reasons and that the department be known as the Department of Corrections in order to stress the rehabilitation of the prisoner in the best interests of the prisoner and the people of the State.</p><p>Only the Legislature can abolish the Prison Commission and transfer the functions and duties to a Director of the Department of Corrections.</p><p>In the meantime, the Governor should appoint a Director of Corrections to take over the prison activities in this State without waiting for Legislative action and a delay of eighteen months or more.</p><p>For a Director someone should be selected who takes pride and pleasure in working to rehabilitate men and women who have violated the law. At the same time he should have executive ability and business experience necessary for the handling of a big enterprise and the vision to bring into practical operation a system of penal administration or corrections, which will aid instead of hinder the rehabilitation of fallen mankind and, at the same time inaugurate a plan and policy of making the inmates of the State's prison institution self-supporting. He should be given full charge of the activities and charged with full responsibility and held accountable for obtaining results.</p><p>(2) Prison Activities.</p><p>(a) General:We found at Tattnall 461 white men, 452 negro men, 108 white women and 237 negro women.</p><p>The men's prison was built to accommodate three thousand five hundred prisoners and we found only a total of 913 there. Practically fifty per cent of this number are idle and spend their time in idleness. A large number of the idle are cripples, have some chronic ailment or are suffering from the effects of syphilis or tuberculosis. Most of them with the exception of those who have tuberculosis are able to do some kind of work and should be employed.</p><p>There are 515 men in the State Road Camps.</p><p>Most of them will be discharged at some time and, if they are not trained and rehabilitated while in prison, they will have only one life open to them after discharge and that is a life of crime and eventually return as a charge on the State. Proper work, feeding and medical care would improve their condition.</p>

<page id="GA1943.2.P65" no="GA1943.2.23" />

<p>At the women's prison we found a total of 345 women. Practically all of them are able to be employed at some kind of work and there is not to be found such a large number of cripples and chronics as among the men.</p><p>Approximately seventy-five of the negro women are used on the farm. The others are employed attending a few chickens, in making of clothing, and cooking and cleaning the building. These activities leave most of them idle and without gainful employment.</p><p>Those in charge of both the men's prison and women's prison apparently do not have sufficient vision and interest to devise methods of employment.</p><p>(b) The Farm:The Farm Superintendent took over the farm the latter part of March. No plans had been made at that late date for this year's crops. Starting from scratch about the first of April he has done a good job to date.</p><p>There are eight thousand acres in the farm. Approximately three thousand acres are under cultivation. The principal crops this year are cotton 220 acres, oats and hay 250 acres, vegetables 300 acres, sugar cane 80 acres, sweet potatoes 200 acres, irish potatoes 25 acres and corn 1800 acres.</p><p>In addition, they expect to produce ten thousand dollars worth of turpentine products in working the pine trees.</p><p>They now have 131 scrub beef cattle, 194 grade white-face beef cattle, 84 steers and heifers, 74 dairy cows and 40 dairy calves.</p><p>There are 68 brood sows, 7 boars and approximately 400 meat hogs. They have a meat curing and cold storage plant and hogs are killed as fast as they grow to be number ones.</p><p>They have no permanent pasture and are now building a 250 acre pasture and as soon as this one is completed another will be started.</p><p>The farm superintendent says that in two years he can increase the herd of hogs until he can raise enough to feed two thousand inmates. In three years he can increase the beef cattle to produce enough to feed the same number of inmates, and in three years a dairy herd can be built up to produce the institution's requirements for milk and butter.</p><p>We are of the opinion that at least two thousand acres should be put into permanent pastures immediately, that more land should be cultivated and that the farm should be made to produce all the feed required by the herds of cattle and hogs and all food that can be grown in Georgia to feed the inmates.</p><p>A large poultry farm should be inaugurated immediately to produce chickens and eggs in large quantities for the inmates.</p><p>The breeding stock of hogs and beef cattle should be increased and supplemented immediately. Milk cows for the dairy should be supplemented and increased immediately.</p><p>They have a growing season of at least nine months out of the year at Tattnall and fine fertile land on which to grow crops. There is no reason why this farm should not produce all the fresh vegetables necessary to feed two or three thousand inmates in season and to can enough to last during the remainder of the year, all the fruits and melons, all the syrup, meal, pork, beef, dairy products, chickens and

<page id="GA1943.2.P66" no="GA1943.2.24" />

eggs, dried beans and peas, sweet potatoes, irish potatoes and feed for the chickens, hogs and cows and work animals, needed for consumption at Tattnall and then have large quantities to sell to other State institutions.</p><p>In addition, it will be possible to grow cotton, peanuts and tobacco as money crops.</p><p>If Tattnall isn't more than self-supporting in a period of three years it will be due to the lack of business ability and vision on the part of the supervising authority.</p><p>(c) Industries.</p><p>(1) Laundry:They seem to have a good laundry outfit at Tattnall and they seem to be doing a good job of what is done. However, not enough laundry work is done. The sheets on the beds were dirty and in some instances filthy. The clothing of the prisoners was dirty and not up to the standard of either repair or cleanliness that we found in other prisons.</p><p>The laundry should be run night and day if necessary to keep the clothing of the inmates and the bed clothing clean.</p><p>(2) Grist Mill:The farm superintendent reports that a grist mill has been requisitioned. One should be installed and the farm should produce and manufacture all of the corn meal and grits used and consumed at the prison and have some left over to sell to other State institutions.</p><p>(3) Syrup Mill:They have a syrup mill on the farm. The farm should produce enough syrup to feed each inmate and to have a surplus to sell to other State institutions.</p><p>(4) Canning and Dehydrating Plant:Tattnall has an up-to-date canning plant and one of the finest dehydrating plants to be found anywhere.</p><p>The canning plant has a daily capacity of three thousand gallons. This year they have canned thirteen thousand gallons of vegetables. With the present prison population, fifty thousand gallons should be produced. The farm should grow and the canning plant produce enough canned vegetables to supply all the needs for a prison population two or three times the size of that at Tattnall now and have a surplus to sell the other State institutions.</p><p>The dehydrating plant has been used very little and can be used for dehydrating an unlimited amount of vegetables and fruits for the use of the State institutions.</p><p>(5) Cold Storage and Meat Curing Plant:They have a fine cold storage and meat curing plant at Tattnall and meats killed there seemed to be properly processed. They have the facilities for killing, storing and processing all of their meat requirements and the farm should be made to produce all of the meat requirements.</p><p>The cold storage plant should be enlarged to take care of vegetables and potatoes.</p><p>(6) Printing Plant:Tattnall has a fair printing plant. They need a linotype machine and various other equipment. In North Carolina the printing plant at the central penitentiary does two-thirds of all the State's printing. We saw them in operation and they do as fine a job as can be obtained at any other printing plant in the State. For the fiscal year ending June 30th, 1943, the printing plant in North

<page id="GA1943.2.P67" no="GA1943.2.25" />

Carolina earned $24,482.11. The printing was done for other State institutions and the regular rates for printing were charged.</p><p>There is no reason why with additional equipment the same thing cannot be done in Georgia. If this is done it will aid the prison to become self-supporting and will give an opportunity to train the younger prisoners in the printing trade. It will help to rehabilitate the men and give them an opportunity to make a decent and honest living after returning to civil life. No intelligent person should object to a prisoner being so employed. It will be gainful and profitable to the State in terms of money and, at the same time, will help reclaim some of our derelicts of humanity.</p><p>(7) Garment Factory:Some of the women at Tattnall are used in the making of a part of the clothing used by the prisoners. They only have a few sewing machines and this is their only equipment. A number of prisoners can be employed very profitably to both the State and themselves in the making of garments and a small garment factory should be installed in the women's prison and a large factory in the men's prison. It will teach a lot of the inmates a trade, keep them busy while they are in prison and will be profitable to the State.</p><p>All of the clothing, sheets and pillow cases used by the prison institutions and the Milledgeville State Hospital should be produced at the women's and men's prisons.</p><p>(8) Mattress Factory:They have a small machine for renovating mattresses at Tattnall. Most all of the mattresses there were absolutely filthy and should not be used by human beings anywhere. They are making a valiant effort with one little machine to recondition and reclaim these mattresses. New ticking and new cotton should be bought and equipment put in to manufacture new ones and to keep them reconditioned from time to time. A factory large enough to make all the mattresses needed by the penal system and at the Milledgeville State Hospital should be installed.</p><p>(9) Sheet Metal Plant:They have a metal plant at Tattnall for the purpose of making automobile tags only. Prior to 1941 machinery was installed for doing all kinds of sheet metal work and they were engaged in the manufacture of metal furniture, metal filing cabinets, etc. A large storeroom is now filled with incompleted metal work in the process of construction at the beginning of 1941.</p><p>All of the essential machinery was sold or loaned during 1941 and 1942 to private industries. We could find no record of the sale or loan. One machine worth eighteen thousand dollars alone was shipped to Oregon.</p><p>In every State that we visited we found that the sheet metal plant was being operated with a profit to the State in making the things required by the State and its institutions. It teaches them a trade, keeps them busy and is a big factor in the rehabilitation of the men.</p><p>In North Carolina the metal working plant at the central prison made a profit of forty thousand dollars for the last fiscal year.</p><p>We recommend that this plant be restored and put in operation as soon as it is practical to do so.</p><p>(10) Furniture Plant:They have a very small wood-working plant at Tattnall. They should have the machinery and equipment to make all of the wood furniture used by the State.</p>

<page id="GA1943.2.P68" no="GA1943.2.26" />

<p>(11) Paint Factory:We found a new building almost completed in January, 1941, to house a paint and soap factory. This building was built out of concrete blocks made on the grounds by the prisoners and was complete with the exceptions of a small portion of concrete flooring and the doors and windows. The building is still standing in the same shape and nothing has been done to it since January, 1941.</p><p>The machinery for the making of the paint and soap had been purchased by the State, part of it had been installed in the new building and part was in the warehouse at Reidsville. Most of the machinery has disappeared since that time. Some of it is installed in the plant.</p><p>This building should be completed by the convicts immediately and the machinery, if it can be found, located and installed, and, if it cannot be found, machinery should be purchased as soon as possible.</p><p>Most of the states which we visited have a small paint factory and manufacture all of the paint used by the State and in one state they told us that they made a profit of twenty-five thousand dollars per year making the paint used in marking the center lines on the State Highway system alone.</p><p>There is no reason why the prisoners at Tattnall cannot manufacture and make all of the paint used by the State and the other Departments of the State Government pay to the Prison Department the regular price for paint.</p><p>(12) Soap Plant:Most of the States which we visited make their own soap and are doing a good job of it and find it very profitable. They not only make the soap used in the penal administration but they make soap for the other state institutions and make a good profit in the operation.</p><p>(13) Shoe Factory:There is not even a repair plant at Tattnall for repairing the shoes of the convicts. Some of the States which we visited not only repair all of the shoes and use them several times but make all of the shoes used by the prisoners and in some instances they sell to the inmates of other State institutions.</p><p>The prisoners at Tattnall could very easily make all of the shoes for the use of all of the prisoners in the State and the inmates of the Milledgeville State Hospital.</p><p>(14) Tobacco Plant:Virginia, North Carolina and Tennessee each have a tobacco plant in which they make the chewing and smoking tobacco issued to the prisoners. This is a very inexpensive plant, teaches a new trade, encourages new industry and is very profitable to the State and we should have one at Tattnall.</p><p>(15) Concrete Pipe:In January of 1941 the State had all of the machinery and equipment necessary for making concrete pipe used by the State Highway Department. This equipment was sold to a State Highway contractor at a very attractive price and is now gone.</p><p>As soon as possible new equipment and machinery should be secured and the State at Tattnall should make all of the concrete pipe used by the State Highway Department.</p><p>(16) Concrete Blocks:They have a machine at Tattnall for making large concrete blocks used in the construction of large and heavy buildings and they are making concrete blocks there now for the use of the prison.</p>

<page id="GA1943.2.P69" no="GA1943.2.27" />

<p>A machine for the making of small concrete blocks or concrete bricks should be secured and the buildings which need to be constructed should be constructed out of this material. A second-hand outfit is available and can be obtained at a reasonable price.</p><p>(17) Machine Shop:There is a very small machine shop at Tattnall and the equipment is so little it is practically worthless and they are unable to do the necessary repair work on the machinery at Tattnall.</p><p>The equipment necessary for the operation of a machine repair shop at least should be obtained and installed.</p><p>(18) Cotton Mill:As soon as conditions permit a small cotton mill should be installed. The cotton should be raised and manufactured to make all of the necessary clothing used by the inmates of the penal system and by those confined at the Milledgeville State Hospital.</p><p>In most all of the other States a cotton mill is operated and they find it to be profitable to the penal institutions and that it gives gainful employment to the prisoners.</p><p>(19) Saw Mill:They have a saw mill at Tattnall and are now engaged in sawing lumber from trees on the place with which to construct needed buildings.</p><p>(20) Construction and Repairs:There should be organized out of the inmates of the prison a construction group to construct all of the buildings and to make all of the repairs used and to be used by the prison system. It would also be possible to use this construction crew in constructing new buildings at other institutions from time to time.</p><p>There are numerous other small industries which can be installed by the State and used to great advantage in rehabilitating the prisoners and enabling them to pay for their keep while incarcerated. The prison management should make an exhaustive study at the conclusion of the present war and organize a system of small prison industries so as to make the prison system self-supporting by manufacturing the things that are used by the various departments and activities of the State.</p><p>Georgia does not have a proper balance between industry and agriculture and the training of some of these men as skilled workers in various industries should contribute to the proper industrialization of this State.</p><p>(3) Prison Welfare:Under this heading we would like to recommend a few things which we believe will aid materially in the rehabilitation of the prisoner and in the making of a great many of them into useful citizens.</p><p>The present system is depressing, is degrading and tends to break down the will of the prisoner to better himself.</p><p>To put it in short the system of prison operation in this State takes away from a man all hope of rehabilitating himself and tends to destroy the ambition of the prisoner to reform and reclaim himself. The system should be so changed as to hold out some hope for the prisoner to improve his condition while in prison and to be able to return to civil life with a chance of becoming a decent, law-abiding citizen and it is with this view in mind that we make the following suggestions.</p>

<page id="GA1943.2.P70" no="GA1943.2.28" />

<p>(1) Personnel:The employee personnel of the prison should be such as to inspire the confidence of the prisoners. In the past we have had men in the position of guards and supervisors who were ignorant and of such type that the prisoners did not and could not respect them. As a matter of fact the administration of any penal system is dependent more upon the personnel of the supervisors than anything else.</p><p>Governor Cooper of Tennessee told us that most any system was a good system with a good supervisory personnel and that no system was a good system with a poor personnel.</p><p>(2) Punishment:The punishment at Tattnall has been by the creation of eight ball squads, by welding of leg irons with long picks on them on the ankles of the prisoners, by beating and flogging and, in some instances, by solitary confinement with a restricted diet. The use of leg irons and all corporal punishment tends to make men desperate and to cause them to lose all hope and then they become dangerous. In Georgia alone did we find this type of punishment and we recommend that all corporal punishment and the use of chains or leg irons of any kind or description be prohibited and forbidden.</p><p>Punishment of a prisoner should be not at the whim of any guard or supervisor. Men lose their patience and the prisoners should not be punished except for a real and a just cause, and then after careful consideration by the warden in charge.</p><p>We recommend that the only type of punishment permitted in Georgia be that of isolation with a restricted diet.</p><p>(3) Stripes:We recommend that no prisoner be required to wear stripes except as for punishment for infraction of prison rules and regulations.</p><p>(4) Hospital:We find a hospital at the men's prison at Tattnall with eighty beds and room for expansion. We find a modern, up-to-date operating room installed and a physician employed on a part-time basis.</p><p>They have a small hospital at one end of the building at the women's prison with 20 beds and all operations on women prisoners are performed at the men's building.</p><p>We recommend that a full-time physician be employed competent to look after the health and welfare of the prisoners.</p><p>The health and physical appearance of the prisoners at Tattnall do not measure up to the health and physical appearance of the prisoners in other institutions that we visited.</p><p>(5) Dentist:A part-time dentist is employed at the prison. He tells us that he does not have time in the short time he has at the prison to even catch up with his work. A large percentage of the prisoners show every evidence of bad teeth and this must of necessity affect their health and make them a burden upon the State and hinders the institution from being self-supporting.</p><p>(6) Chaplain:We find that the State employs a full-time chaplain who is really just beginning his work. We did not have an opportunity to talk with him but he has made a good impression upon the officials and the prisoners. In addition to his regular services we are of the opinion that the chaplain should devote all of his spare time in an effort at the educational rehabilitation of the prisoners.</p>

<page id="GA1943.2.P71" no="GA1943.2.29" />

<p>Prison Administrators in every State which we have visited state that rehabilitation cannot be accomplished by regimentation and that it must be on a personal basis with each prisoner.</p><p>Therefore, the chaplain should have time and should devote a great deal of his time to personal contact with the prisoners in an effort to aid in their rehabilitation.</p><p>We recommend that a chapel be constructed at Tattnall where religious services can be held away from the prison atmosphere. Services now are held in one of the dining rooms.</p><p>(7) School and Library:There are no schools of any kind operated for the prisoners. They have just started a library and it is woefully small and inadequate. It is boarded off in a corner of one of the dining rooms and the prisoners should have an opportunity to spend their spare time in reading good books, good magazines and the daily papers instead of sitting around with idle brains brooding over the hopelessness of their fate. There are long hours of the night and off time when prisoners who have no activities and nothing to do should be given an opportunity of keeping their minds busy by reading.</p><p>It is our opinion that a large percentage of crime is due to ignorance and the inability of persons handicapped to earn a living for themselves. Consequently, they stray into the field of rackets and step across into activities which are forbidden by law. With their limited ability illegal activities hold out what to their minds is their only economic hope.</p><p>If we are correct in this premise a lot of crime is due to false training and false information. If we are correct in these suppositions then it seems that every opportunity should be taken to remedy as best we can the situation and equip the prisoner to earn a living and to rehabilitate himself when his sentence expires or when he is paroled.</p><p>Therefore, it is essential that we undertake to train the minds of men and women who are incarcerated in prison.</p><p>In Tennessee the work day starts early in the morning and ends at four-thirty Central War time and after four-thirty until the lights are out at night every prisoner has an opportunity to go to school. In this school they have only one paid instructor and he is the principal in charge of the school. Other teachers are inmates. They teach everything from repairing radios to typewriting and shorthand.</p><p>They operate schools for those who cannot read and write and they offer the regular courses prescribed for grammar and high schools.</p><p>Approximately sixty per cent of the inmates at the central prison have voluntarily enrolled in these schools and they attend the schools during their off time from work after they have made a full day shift.</p><p>We recommend that such a school be established at Tattnall and that an adequate library be furnished.</p><p>(8) Segregation:At the men's prison at Tattnall the white men are segregated from the negro men. At the women's prison the white women are segregated from the negro women. First offenders are segregated from other prisoners and youthful

<page id="GA1943.2.P72" no="GA1943.2.30" />

offenders are also segregated in another class and kept separate. They have a pretty fair system of segregation in operation.</p><p>However, there is one bad feature of this system. In many cases the first offenders are just as hard and desperate criminals as some who have violated the law several times. Therefore we think that the system of segregation should go further and should be based upon some system of intelligent classification.</p><p>(9) Classification:The history, the background, and the personality of each prisoner should be carefully studied at a reception center when they are first admitted to the prison system and here they should be classified and distributed to different jobs in accordance with the type and character of the prisoner and in accordance with what he is best suited to do.</p><p>Also it should be kept in mind in the system of classification the handling of a prisoner so as to teach him some trade and assure maximum results in rehabilitating him and fitting him to return to civil life at the conclusion of the term of his sentence or at the time of his parole.</p><p>(10) Recreation:Saturday afternoons and Sundays are given the prisoners for recreation. However, they have no planned or supervised recreation. When they come from work in the daytime they are locked up in the cells or dormitories. After working hours and before bedtime they should be given an opportunity for recreation every day. Nothing will help their morale more than being given an opportunity to read, to go to school or to engage in some form of recreation.</p><p>If an idle brain is a devil's workshop, certainly the brooding mind of a person incarcerated in prison is a fertile field for deviltry and this time should be occupied with some type of activity to be selected by the prisoner.</p><p>(11) Gain Time:In most of the States visited by us there is provided by law an automatic reduction in the sentence of each man whose record of conduct shows that he has faithfully observed all of the rules of the prison and made a good prisoner.</p><p>For instance, in Alabama for the first year there is an automatic reduction of five days for each month. From one to three years six days each month, from three to five years seven days per month and graduated likewise, to a maximum reduction of ten days for each month.</p><p>In some of the States this gain time on long sentences runs as high as fifteen days per month and in the State of Tennessee good conduct alone can reduce a twenty-year sentence to ten years and five months.</p><p>We recommend that a system of gain time be enacted into law at the next session of the Legislature and that the Parole Board institute some such system which they will recognize in applications for parole to be in effect between now and the convening of the next session of the Legislature.</p><p>(12) Good Conduct CreditIn addition to the gain time provided by law some of the States add a few days each month for honor prisoners on account of excellent conduct. The gain time and the honor time hold out an inducement to a prisoner to rehabilitate himself and to adjust himself to living and working with other people. They instill in the minds of the prisoners a ray of hope instead of taking all hope from him and causing him to become desperate and decidedly antisocial.</p>

<page id="GA1943.2.P73" no="GA1943.2.31" />

<p>(13) Honor System:Most of these states have some kind of honor system. In most of them the prisoners are divided into three classes. In most of them they are rated in class A, B, and C. When he enters prison he is classed as a Class B prisoner. Then, he has opportunity to work himself either into a Class A prisoner, the honor grade, or into Class C. In Class A they are trusties and do not work under a gun. They have certain privileges that others do not have.</p><p>In Class C they usually wear stripes and are given additional duties and they lose all of the gain and honor time they have accumulated. However, they have an opportunity after the end of a certain fixed period to work themselves back into Class B and when they get in Class B they have an opportunity within a certain definite length of time to work themselves into the A or honor class.</p><p>We recommend that a similar system be inaugurated in the operation of the penitentiary system of this State. In this manner prisoners have an incentive to observe prison rules and to be good prisoners and to have an incentive to work diligently to improve their lot while in prison and to fit themselves to be decent citizens when they are discharged from prison.</p><p>(14) Cooperation of the Parole Board:In our opinion there can be no intelligent prison administrative system in this State without the close cooperation of the Parole Board. For instance, under the law at the present time no credit for honor conduct or any gain time for making good prisoners can be automatically granted. We recommend that the Parole Board and the penal administration work out a system of gain time and honor time and that the Supervisor of the prison administration be authorized to certify in each case as to whether or not a prisoner is entitled to gain or honor and that the Parole Board should agree to abide by the decision of the prison administration official. This system should be inaugurated immediately and should be agreed to by the Parole Board and each prisoner notified of the terms of the system and of the fact that it will be recognized and enforced by the Parole Board.</p><p>There are numbers of young girls and young boys at Tattnall prison. There are now seventy boys at Tattnall who are under the age of eighteen. The lowest is twelve years of age. Among this group are forty-one serving felony sentences and twenty-nine serving misdemeanor sentences.</p><p>The most striking thing about the inmates of the women's prison is the number of young women either in their teens or their early twenties. It strikes us that there is a fertile field for the Parole Board among this group of young people.</p><p>In one State which we visited they have kept a record of the parolees and those who have served their full sentences over a period of fifteen years. Prison officials in this state tell us that fifteen per cent of the parolees have come back and fifty-seven per cent of those who have served their full sentences have been repeaters and returned to the penitentiary.</p><p>They say that this condition is due to the workings of the Parole system. They say that before a man is paroled that a bona fide job with a decent living wage is secured for him and that the home or place where he proposes to live is inspected and that he is turned out with a good place to live and a good job. Consequently the large percentage of parolees make good and do not again lead a life of crime.</p>

<page id="GA1943.2.P74" no="GA1943.2.32" />

<p>On the other hand they claim that those who serve their full sentences leave the penitentiary with a suit of clothes, a ticket to the place from which they were sentenced and five dollars in cash. When they apply for a job they must admit that they are just out of prison and consequently fail to secure a job. As soon as the five dollars is gone and they are unable to find a job they readily fall into some racket or into some criminal activity and in a short time a majority of them come back to prison for the State to take care of.</p><p>In these times when there is a shortage of manpower the parole system has a much better opportunity to be successful than in times of financial stress. In these times jobs are easily found and these youthful first offenders can be easily placed in good jobs and amongst good living conditions.</p><p>While we do not advocate the turning out of people from prison merely to aid the manpower shortage we believe that the ease with which jobs can be obtained for these people affords a much better opportunity to rehabilitate the prisoner than in ordinary times. These youthful first offenders can be more easily rehabilitated by getting them a job and a good home than by allowing them to serve their sentences and then turning them out without any jobs, without any homes, and without any prospects of securing a job at a decent living wage.</p><p>Therefore, we hope that the Parole Board will exercise themselves to place these youthful offenders and give them an opportunity. If they fail they can be picked up by the arresting officers or by the Parole Supervisor and returned to serve the balance of their sentences.</p><p>The same thing applies to a lot of first offenders who are in prison and we are of the opinion that by the exercising of the parole during times when jobs are plentiful that the maximum results can be secured from the parole.</p><p>If these seventy young boys could be placed out under parole and if only fifteen per cent of them returned to prison on account of the violation of the terms of their paroles or on account of the violation of some other law it would be well worth the experiment to the people of Georgia.</p><p>(15) We recommend that the next Legislature enact a law so as to authorize the prison administration to transfer persons sentenced to the penitentiary who are under the age of eighteen to the State reform schools, in his discretion, and to transfer them back to the penitentiary under such conditions as he may see fit.</p><p>(16) Food:The prisoners at Tattnall seem to be well fed. However, they are not fed as well as at the average institution visited by us. While we only saw them eat one meal you can readily observe a man and tell whether or not he is well fed and they do not have the appearance of being well fed as in other places.</p><p>We are of the opinion that the food could be better prepared. Prisoners always complain of the food. However, we think that more care should be devoted to the preparation of foods and to the cooking of foods and that the food at Tattnall should be greatly improved.</p><p>With increased production of foodstuffs and a stricted supervision of the preparation we believe that the prisoner can easily be adequately fed with plenty of plain, ordinary food without any additional expense.</p>

<page id="GA1943.2.P75" no="GA1943.2.33" />

<p>Nothing affects the morale of a prisoner or any other class of people more readily than their food. If we expect to get competent work out of the prisoners and if we expect to rehabilitate them they must be well fed and well cared for.</p><p>(4) State Camps:Most of the states visited by us do not maintain state road camps. Two or three of them do. None of them maintain road camps for construction purposes. The activities of the convicts are limited to maintenance. In each of these states they state that the camps have not been successful from a financial standpoint and they have been kept at a dead loss to the State. One or two of them claim that they are profitable now because they cannot get other labor at any price.</p><p>However, we are of the opinion that the State road camps are not profitable to this State, that they are a burden financially and that their operation does not aid in the rehabilitation of the prisoners. Last year between five and six hundred prisoners cost the State Highway Department $401,679.55 for maintenance alone.</p><p>We are of the opinion that the prisoners properly employed at Tattnall can be self-supporting and that they can be under conditions which will be more conducive to their rehabilitation.</p><p>Therefore, we recommend the immediate abolishment of all the State road camps, and the transfer of the prisoners to Tattnall. Under the new plan of operations they will be needed.</p><p>(5) County Camps:We recommend that the Director of the Department of Corrections promulgate rules and regulations for the operation of county camps. That he establish standards governing the employment of wardens and guards and schedules of pay. That he establish standards for meals to be fed to prisoners and require a strict compliance with them. That he also provide methods of punishment in keeping with this report.</p><p>We recommend that the Legislature require grand juries of each county to regularly inspect and supervise the conduct of county camps and that the local grand jury be charged with the responsibility to see that the rules and regulations of caring for prisoners and the conduct of county camps be enforced.</p><p>We also recommend that a strict system of supervision and regular inspection of county camps be maintained by the Director of the Department of Corrections.</p><p>(6) Conclusion:We traveled into these States in a Highway Patrol car and the State furnished our transportation. We paid all our expenses.</p><p>The Atlanta Journal sent Mr. C. E. Gregory with us and the Atlanta Constitution sent Mr. Lamar Q. Ball. They traveled with us in the State Patrol car and paid their own expenses. Their cooperation and their work on this trip was of inestimable value to us and to the State. Through their papers they have reported to the people of Georgia what we found in this State and in the other States which we visited and there is no finer report than we can make to you of the conditions in this State and in the other States than to refer you to their articles.</p><p>We could not conclude this report in a better way than to do so in the words of Governor Cooper of Tennessee and Governor Johnston of South Carolina. Governor Cooper said, Treat a prisner fairly, feed him well and keep him busy and

<page id="GA1943.2.P76" no="GA1943.2.34" />

you will have a successful system. And, Governor Johnston said, If a Governor doesn't keep his eye closely on his prison system it will get away from him.</p><p>And, we add to what these Governors have said, that there must be experienced and intelligent men in charge of all prison institutions who would rather see a man rehabilitated as a useful citizen than to keep him in prison.</p><pre>Respectfully submitted,<br set="RIGHT">FRANK C.

HARRIS,<br set="RIGHT"><i>Speaker of the House.</i><br set="RIGHT" /></br></br></br></br></pre><p>This September 14, 1943.</p><p>TO HIS EXCELLENCY, THE GOVERNOR:</p><p>We, the undersigned committee, have visited all the prison camps of the State including County and State. We found in the State a small group of camps, the management of which we wish to commend, while on the other hand we found the majority of the camps to be operating with inadequate buildings and equipment and without any regard to utilizing the lands in connection with the camp for the production of crops and livestock and under very poor management or supervision. By way of illustration, we found a few camps where the buildings were clean and adequate, where special attention was given to the cultivation and production of crops for the purpose of feeding the men a complete and balanced diet, including the production of cattle, hogs and poultry for use in the camp to such an extent that the camps were apparently self-sustaining. While on the other hand, we found many camps where the buildings and equipment were totally inadequate, the management grossly inefficient, and while there was ample land for the production of crops, livestock and poultry, no effort was being made to produce same and no apparent inclination on the part of the management or governing authorities in the county to encourage such.</p><p>We found such evidence of cruel and inhumane treatment of prisoners on the part of certain wardens and guards such as the use of picks or leg irons, the use of improperly ventilated sweat boxes with grossly inadequate sanitary facilities, together with mistreatment of prisoners by so-called walking bosses who resort to the use of clubs, sticks and other brutal means of punishment. We found in many instances that such treatment of prisoners had definitely proven injurious to the prisoners' health and was certainly not conducive to the purpose of rehabilitation.</p><p>With reference to the State Prison at Tattnall, the most apparent cause of unrest and dissension was obviously from the lack of proper employment in the prison, there being hundreds of prisoners walking around or aimlessly wandering through the prison with no apparent purpose in mind or duties to perform.</p><p>We recommend that the Tattnall Prison give special attention to the development of such industries within the prison as to provide such necessary items used by the prison system or the State as practical.</p><p>Without further endeavoring to burden the record with details, and after a careful and studied analysis of the case based on our investigation, we believe the

<page id="GA1943.2.P77" no="GA1943.2.35" />

first difficulty in connection with the administration of penal affairs in the State is the result of an almost complete lack of intelligent direction, therefore our studied conclusions in the matter are there should first be appointed a competent director of penal affairs with power to act, and that said director should have full and complete control of Tattnall Prison and all State prisons. That in connection with Tattnall Prison and prison farm that there be appointed under the supervision of said director a competent agricultural and livestock assistant whose duties would be to supervise the planning of crop and livestock production on the farm. That there be another assistant at the Reidsville Prison whose duties would be to see that the plans of the agricultural and livestock expert are carried out and the actual work accomplished. We further recommend that all convict camps, both State and County, be under the direct supervision of said director of penal affairs and that said director be in power to formulate certain rules, regulations and standards for the governing of said prison and camps which, in his opinion, would best serve the needs of the Georgia Prison System. And that he be empowered to require of the county authorities that they meet such standard or suffer the loss of all State prisoners, and that said director be also required to give special attention and consideration to the matter of producing agricultural and livestock products in the various camps, and to urge and require, where practical, the acquiring of a sufficient amount of land for the carrying on of such program in setting up said standard.</p><p>We further recommend that the indiscriminate use in the camps of picks or leg irons on the prisoners, the present excessive use of sweat boxes, the striking or abusing of prisoners by either the wardens, the guards, or the walking bosses be positively prohibited on penalty of immediate discharge of such guilty person or persons. And that said director set up rules governing the humane punishment in the use of solitary confinement.</p><p>In the event a director, as recommended, shall be appointed we further recommend that said director be empowered to institute a merit system providing suitable rewards for those prisoners who demonstrate efficiency in their work together with good behavior.</p><p>In view of the foregoing recommendations and report, we further recommend that the Governor, in his discretion, take such steps as are deemed necessary in order to bring about the correction of the present system, keeping in mind the recommendations of this committee.</p><pre>JOHN L.

HARRIS, AND MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:</p><p>Pursuant to the Resolution adopted by the House of Representatives on September 28, 1943, requesting an explanation with reference to parole in misdemeanor cases, the State Board of Pardons and Paroles respectfully submits the following portions of the Act creating this Board and pertinent sections from our Policies, Rules and Regulations:</p><p><i>First:</i> Section 23 of Senate Bill Number Five reads:</p><p><blockquote><p>The Board may adopt and promulgate rules and regulations, not inconsistent with the provisions of this Act, touching all matters herein dealt with, including, among others, the practice and procedure in matters pertaining to paroles, pardons, probations and remission of fines and forfeitures.</p></blockquote></p><p><i>Second:</i> In compliance with this provision and the Resolution of the General Assembly of Georgia of March 19, 1943, directing the Board to consider applications in misdemeanor cases, eligibility rules were adopted by the

<page id="GA1943.2.P89" no="GA1943.2.47" />

Board, as shown on page 5 of the attached copy of our Policies, Rules and Regulations. We quote as follows:</p><p><blockquote><p><i>Misdemeanor Cases</i>Prisoners serving a misdemeanor sentence become eligible for parole consideration, upon application, after completion of six months of the sentence imposed, without good time.</p><p><i>Felony Prisoners</i>Persons convicted of a felony will become eligible for parole consideration upon completion of service of one-third of the minimum sentence, without good time. This ruling also applies to flat sentences. A MINIMUM OF SIX MONTHS SHOULD BE SERVED IN ALL CASES BEFORE A PRISONER IS ELIGIBLE FOR PAROLE CONSIDERATION.</p></blockquote></p><p>With further reference to the eligibility rules, the Board's policy is as follows:</p><p><blockquote><p>Rules covering eligibility consideration are subject to exception. The Board will consider any showing made by the prisoner or his representative, in writing, as to why his case should be considered prior to the eligibility date. If the prisoner has an attorney or representative who desires a hearing, one will be granted by the Board, upon request, on the first or third Tuesday of any month.</p></blockquote></p><p>For further exception to the general eligibility rule of six months, we respectfully call attention to our section on Commutation, which reads as follows:</p><p><blockquote><p>In presuming that all court sentences are fair, correct and just, the policy of the State Board of Pardons and Paroles is to respect and uphold judgments of the court. However, the Board will consider the reduction of a sentence imposed under its commutation powers when (1) a statement is received from the trial judge, certifying that in his opinion the sentence imposed was excessive; (2) when sufficient evidence is submitted to the Board which clearly indicates the sentence is unreasonable and excessive; or (3) whenever it can be shown to the satisfaction of the Board that commutation of the sentence would be for the best interest of society and the one convicted.</p></blockquote></p><p>In further explanation, the State Board of Pardons and Paroles wishes to state that it has endeavored to administer the provisions of the Bill creating the Board and also the Senate Resolution of March 19, 1943, on an impartial and strictly meritorious basis, both in felony and misdemeanor cases. All applications for parole in misdemeanor cases have been investigated and considered in accordance with the rules and regulations promulgated by this Board.</p><p>The State Board of Pardons and Paroles feels that the question presented by the House of Representatives is fully answered by the quotations from the Policies, Rules and Regulations adopted by this Board. However, if further explanation is needed in any particular, the Board will be happy to submit same upon request. If this rule is working a hardship or injustice, we will be glad to consider modifying the regulation.</p>

SPEAKER</p><p>AND MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:</p><p>The General Assembly merited the appreciation of the citizens of Georgia, when, earlier this year, it liberated education from political tyranny, provided a retirement system for our teachers, granted the elective franchise to a large group of courageous young Georgians, and established firmly the doctrine of democratic processes in conducting the government of our State.</p><p>On the occasion of your adjournment of that session, I said to this Assembly that I believed it was the best in Georgia's long and honorable history.</p><p>Today I repeat that statement. While not adopting all of the suggestions I made to you, yet your accomplishment in this brief five day session will be historic. Once again you have given proof that democratic processes and constitutional methods are able to solve our problems; that democracies know how to act promptly; that the system of representative government is effective; that free discussion is a better remedy for public ills than peremptory orders backed by bayonets.</p><p>In providing a humane correctional system for fellow-Georgians who have wronged society, you have not only removed physical shackles from their limbs and fear of the lash from their hearts, but you have given them, instead of malice and hatred to manking, a renewed faith in the decency and generosity of their fellow men and removed the shackles of spiritual hopelessness that degraded them. The degradation of any man is the degredation of every man; society has no right to practices that it would condemn with propriety in the individual.</p><p>The State of Georgia, so long maligned because of the infamy attached to its penal system, and every right thinking citizen of Georgia is grateful to the members of the General Assembly for a prompt and complete fulfillment of their duty, in a manner that can but add lustre to the name of our State as it attaches honor to your own.</p><pre>ELLIS ARNALL<br set="RIGHT"><i>Governor</i><br set="RIGHT" /></br></pre><p>ea/gc</p></div></div><div><p>The following message was received from the Senate through Mrs. Nevin, the Secretary thereof:</p>

<p>We have been here for a period of five days and have completed the reform measures and now stand ready to adjourn sine die.</p><p>This is the shortest extra session of the Legislature ever held in the State of Georgia and in my opinion the shortest on record to be held in any State.</p><p>Please remember that the regular 70 day session of the Legislature held the first of the year was cut short by five days and even with the extra session this General Assembly has only consumed 70 days and this extra session has cost the State no more than would have been paid by the State had we remained in session for a period of 70 days during the early part of the year.</p><p>Let me congratulate you on the fine spirit and this fine service that you have rendered the people of Georgia. The members of this present General Assembly have restored the reputation of the Legislative Branch of the Government to its old time place of respect and dignity. Democratic Government cannot continue without the Legislative Branch of the Government functioning as it was intended to function as the supreme directing force in the Government. At the last session we went a long way towards restoring the parliamentary system of Government in this State and the record that you have made in the regular session and in this extraordinary session will make it possible for the next Legislature to completely restore the parliamentary system of Government in Georgia.</p><p>It should be restored and the Legislature should continue to assume a bigger part in the administration of state affairs. It is only through the functioning of a strong and efficient legislative branch of the Government that dictatorship can be avoided and dictatorship kept from coming to power.</p><p>Again I congratulate you. Again I wish to thank you personally for your cooperation, your kindness and your courtesies. I hope that you will find the members of your family well and happy, and that before long your sons and brothers will be returned to the family fireside from the battle fields of the world.</p><p>Mr. Johnson of Chattahoochee County, Chairman of the Committee on Enrollment, submitted the following report:</p><p>Mr. Speaker:</p><p>Your Committee on Enrollment has examined, found properly enrolled and ready for transmission to the Governor the following bill and resolution of the House to wit: House Bill No. 2 and House Resolution No. 8.</p><pre>Respectfully submitted,<br set="RIGHT">Johnson of Chattahoochee,<br set="RIGHT">Chairman.<br set="RIGHT" /></br></br></pre><p>The following resolution of the House was read and adopted:</p><p>HR 15.

Hand of Mitchell, Hagan of Screven, and Heard of Elbert.</p><p>The hour of convening the joint session of the Senate and the House having arrived, the president, accompanied by the secretary and senators, proceeded to the hall of the House of Representatives to hear an address from his Excellency, the Governor.</p><p>The resolution authorizing the joint session of the Senate and the House was ready by the secretary of the Senate.</p><p>His Excellency, the Governor, addressed the General Assembly as follows:</p><div><title>THE ARMED FORCES AND THE ELECTION<br set="CENTER" /></title><p>Our country has been at war for more than two years. The men of Georgia's National Guard have been on active duty for almost four years, for the most of which time they have been on foreign assignment. Almost a quarter of a million men and women of our State are in the armed services of our country.</p><p>In 1944 we will hold a general election and party primaries of exceptional importance.</p><p>I tell you today, it is necessary that provision be made for these men and women in the services to exercise their right to vote.</p><p>They desire to exercise that right. Their fellow citizens, by overwhelming ratification of the amendment reducing the voting age, which this General Assembly submitted to the voters last year, have expressed their determination that their sons and daughters, their brothers and sisters, who are serving our common country, shall not be disfranchised.</p><p>It is not beyond the realm of possibility that Congress may enact some measure permitting those in the services to vote for Federal officials; for electors for President and Vice-President, for Senators and for Congressmen. But such a measure, even if it were legal and were enacted speedily into law by the Congress, could not

<page id="GA1943.2.P124" no="GA1943.2.9" />

permit service men and women to vote for State and county officials. It could not provide for participation in party primaries by men and women in the services. In Georgia, the local and State primaries are usually the equivalent of election. It is in the primary that the great majority of our boys and girls overseas and in the camps wish to vote. Provision for this requires substantial changes in our election laws.</p><p>Therefore, I have asked the General Assembly of Georgia to meet and to consider and to enact legislation that will permit qualified citizens of Georgia now in the services to participate in the State elections, and that will permit qualified members of any political party to vote in the primaries held by that party.</p><p>We must recognize, however, that it will be utterly impossible to see to it that every man and woman in the military service participates in our elections. Time and distance and military secrecy are difficult to conquer. It will not be possible for American soldiers interned in Japanese prison camps to exercise their elective franchise. It will not be possible for those on duty at secret assignments in inaccessible places throughout the world to participate. But we can do our best to afford them the opportunity. We can keep the record straight.</p><p>I know that it is at no small sacrifice that the members of the General Assembly meet at this session. There are innumerable obligations at home to be fulfilled as the year begins. However, if the votes of your fellow-citizens, who are defending our common country on seven seas and upon six continents and in the air above Fortress Europe, are to be counted in the primary and the election held this year, prompt action through legislation is needed.</p><p>We have heard a great deal in recent debates in Congress, in recent speeches and articles, about State's rights.</p><p>The preservation of State's rights depends, I am convinced, upon the ready acceptance by the States of their responsibilities.</p><p>The primary responsibility of any government is the preservation of the individual rights of the citizens, of which the political and civil rights are the most important because all other rights depend upon their free exercise.</p><p>That is the tradition in Georgia. It has been the practice in Georgia since the elections held in the days of Button Gwinnett and in the days of Archibald Bulloch. It was the practice in Georgia in the days when our nation was plunged into the desolating strife of the War Between the States.</p><p>It is a tradition solidly grounded upon firm principles. In this nation, we do not resort to the militaristic scheme of a huge standing army; we rely upon a civilian army, a citizens' army; we trust in the courage and loyalty, the honor and patriotism of the youth of our nation.</p><p>The tradition of a patriotic citizenry springing to arms in the defense of the liberties that alone can make life dear is strong in Georgia. From that eventful morning when Oglethorpe's handful of colonists crushed at Bloody Marsh the trained

<page id="GA1943.2.P125" no="GA1943.2.10" />

and picked professional soldiers of Spain, through the agonies of military occupation during the Revolution that was broken through the resourcefulness and courage of Georgia irregulars, through the sad and gallant days when members of Georgia companies marked their ballots around the campfires of the Army of Northern Virginia, our State has preserved the belief that the citizen-soldier is no less citizen because he has laid aside for the moment the cap-and-gown of the scholar, the tools of the artisan or the plow of the farmer, to bear arms in defense of his home, his freedom and his honor.</p><p>Provisions for absentee voting by soldiers were simple in 1777 and 1861. The number of individuals involved was proportionately smaller than today. Generally the units were made up of men from the same State, and, in very many cases, from the same county.</p><p>Today the sons of Georgia are farther from their native land than Vicksburg or Richmond. Today they are scattered, except for those in the National Guard. and march shoulder to shoulder with boys from Vermont and Oregon and Kansas.</p><p>The simple measures, sufficient to insure their participation in the elections of 1777 and 1861, are inadequate to safeguard their voting in 1944.</p><p>But the principle remains unchanged. We must not deprive any man of his voice in our government because he has been called by that government to the supreme test of his loyalty to his country and his fellow citizens.</p><p>The honor of Georgia would be sullied, the faith of Georgia would be broken, the tradition of Georgia would be dishonored if the men driving through the perilous jungles of New Guinea, or standing sentry in the desolate wastes of Iceland, or aboard some vessel of our Navy in the Sea of Japan, should be deprived of their voice in the government of their country, their State or their nation because we took no action upon this problem.</p><p>Accordingly, I have asked the members of the General Assembly to come to our State Capital and study the question and seek a way by which the votes of our citizens absent upon high duty to our nation may be recorded.</p><p>The legislation that I believe is desired by the people of Georgia in this emergency would provide, among other things, for a simple system of registration for the members of our military so that those not now registered may easily do so. Provision should be made for moving up our primaries, elections and qualification dates, where necessary, so as to afford sufficient time for the casting of ballots by men and women in service. Sufficient time should be given so that those at farstretched outposts who are qualified to participate in our primaries and elections may do so. We must abolish the poll tax as an assessment and prerequisite for voting against the men and women in the military service of our country.</p><p>It is my recommendation to the Assembly that a War Ballot Commission be created to harmonize voting laws and to serve as a tribunal to expedite and facilitate soldier voting. Such a War Ballot Commission could serve as an agency to which

<page id="GA1943.2.P126" no="GA1943.2.11" />

the Federal Government could give its cooperation in carrying out the purposes of an Act of the Georgia General Assembly providing for soldier voting. The legislation enacted should simplify absentee voting. It should provide an easy way of obtaining a ballot, and an easy way for returning it to the election holders. It is my recommendation that the proposed legislation be temporary, terminating upon the convening of the next regular General Assembly after the end of the present war.</p><p>The effect of such legislation simply would be that all persons who, if they were in their home county, could vote in a general election can vote in the general election, and that all persons who, if they were at home could vote in the primary, can vote in the primary. The legislation would not increase the number of persons eligible to vote above the number that would be eligible if they were at home instead of abroad or in a training camp. It would not reduce the qualifications for voting. It would aim at one thing and only one thing: facilitating the voting by the men and women in service, assuring them of the right of participating in the government of the country they are defending.</p><p>Such measures are in the tradition of this State, which, historians believe, probably was the first in the Nation to provide for the counting of votes by its men in the service during the period of the War Between the States. It would be peculiarly fitting for Georgia to be the first State of the Union to enact such legislation in this war.</p><p>I have emphasized the participation of the men and women now in service in the primary and in the election of State and local officers, because without action by the State through its General Assembly they could participate effectively in neither, no matter what action was taken by the Congress. However, there has been no measure enacted by Congress dealing with the votes of those in service for Federal officers. There is grave possibility that no valid, effective and constitutional legislation will be or can be enacted.</p><p>I may say that this view is shared by Georgia's distinguished Senior Senator, Walter F. George, one of the Nation's great constitutional lawyers as well as a public servant with a high sense of responsibility and lofty ideals of patriotism.</p><p>Senator George, as you know, has been deeply interested in the subject of voting by those in service. His own flesh and blood wear the uniform of our country; one of his sons already has paid the last full measure of devotion to its cause. For that reason, in part, no doubt, no less than because of his deep faith in the orderly processes of democratic government, Senator George has suggested State action as a needful safeguard to insure that the votes of Georgia service men and women reach the ballot box.</p><p>There are certain unanswerable arguments demanding that action be taken to insure the sanctity of the soldiers' ballots.</p><p>Foremost is the thesis of democratic principles. In this free nation, we believe that government exists solely by the will of the people; we believe that every citizen has a right to participate in making the laws by which we must live and in selecting

<page id="GA1943.2.P127" no="GA1943.2.12" />

the officials who shall administer those laws; we believe that the welfare of our country in time of peace can be entrusted to the votes of our people, and that its security in time of war can be maintained by their service in its cause.</p><p>We do not believe that a boy is unfit to be a citizen and a voter because he risked his life in the Salerno landing. We do not believe that a girl is unfit to be a citizen and a voter because she served her country as a grease monkey in the WAC or as a nurse in an up-front hospital or as a weather-watcher in the WAVES.</p><p>I hope that Georgia will not see the day when the uniform of our country will be the badge of disfranchisement for the man or woman who wears it.</p><p>There is likewise the vital question of the interest these young men and young womenten million in the nation, more than 200,000 of them from Georgiahave in the future of our country.</p><p>They will come back to us after the war. This is their home. This is their country. If it is a country worth dying for, it must be a country worth living in. Whether it passes through the transition period of the postwar years into a prosperous, busy nation, where individual rights are respected, depends upon the type of government that we have on every levellocal, State and nationalon the day when the war ends.</p><p>The public officials chosen this year will shape the peace. The President chosen next November and his cabinet will write the peace treaty; the Senate of which a third of the members are chosen this year will consider that treaty; the Congress chosen this year will provide the funds and levy the taxes and write the laws to implement the peace. The State Legislature chosen in the fall primary will consider the issues in our State developing in the changing world; they will even pass upon a revision of our basic constitutional law. The local officials chosen in 1944 must be the ones to handle the difficult problems of converting communities from a war basis to one of peace.</p><p>It is imperative that the men and women who serve in this war have a share in writing the peace and in shaping the postwar world.</p><p>That world will belong to their generation and to their children. They will have saved it from the menaces of foreign enemies and totalitarian ideologies. If in their absence, through injustice to them, democracy is subverted by the cynicism of us at home, by denying them the stature of free men and citizens to a vote, the consequences may well be serious.</p><p>They unquestionably will feel a deep resentment against the men and the system that denied them their rights. They will feel that the plans for America or Georgia or their home county made without their consent are not binding upon them. They will feel that they have been defrauded of their birthright while they were risking their lives to preserve our own.</p><p>Likewise, I believe that we need in public affairs the special values that these

<page id="GA1943.2.P128" no="GA1943.2.13" />

fine young men and women will bring. Although the Selective Service Act has reached to those in the thirties the bulk of the armed forces of America, especially those serving overseas, is made up of those in their twenties together with those of the teen age group that, in Georgia, have been given the franchise.</p><p>The issues that we will confront at the ballot boxes in 1944 will be tremendously important. They involve America's place in world affairs and America's domestic policy in the postwar transition period.</p><p>Upon those issues we well may take guidance from the men and women who fight, who possess yet enthusiasm and audacity and courage and unselfishness.</p><p>Christmas morning, Mrs. Arnall, my little son and I drove to Newnan to gather around the family hearthstone. My younger brother was there, granted seven days' leave on his way to take special training for duties that shortly will carry him ovearseas. He was a little taller, a little broader, a little more mature than when I last saw him. With the tremendous earnestness of young men, his mind was upon two things: the job he had to do and the world he was coming back to when that job was over.</p><p>That is what all of them are thinking about, these young men that you pass every day on the street, some of them laughing and joking and others with their minds apparently off in a cloud somewhere. All of them, your sons and your younger brothers and the boy next door, and thinking about the job they've got to do and the world that they will face when they come back from doing it.</p><p>They deserve and they must have a hand in the shaping of that world.</p><p>A fitting sense of gratitude to those who have ransomed our way of living and our very lives at the cost of their comfort and their lives, demands that we give those in our country's service a voice in the management of its affairs.</p><p>The right to vote is far from complete recompense to a man who has waded ashore under a hail of machine gun bullets on some South Pacific beach head, and spent days and nights on short rations in a foxhole while Zeros droned overhead, and hacked his way through miles of tangled jungle infested by poisonous snakes, stinging insects and Jap snipers. There is neither gold enough, nor honors enough, nor medals enough to repay a man for that!</p><p>But the knowledge that his fellow-citizens back home recognize the degree of his sacrifice, and are willing to go to the trouble to see that he is treated as a full citizen of the nation for which he fights, is the one type of repayment unworthy neither of the nation nor its heroes.</p><p>Democracy is not well served nor its cause furthered when the men fighting for its triumph are denied a share in the government of their country. One of the criticisms that the apostles of Hitler's totalitarian doctrines has leveled at the democratic countries is that they are unable to act in time of crisis, that their techniques of representative government have worn out that legislative bodies have lost their effectiveness.</p>

<page id="GA1943.2.P129" no="GA1943.2.14" />

<p>I think, in Georgia, we have given them a demonstration that this is not true. We have proved that democratic government can be efficient and that effective solutions to our problems can be found by the representatives of the people.</p><p>The accomplishments of the Georgia General Assembly during the twelve months that have just passed have been illuminating illustrations of how a democratic, constitutional, representative system can work. You have given proof that State governments can solve the problems of their citizens. The basic reforms submitted by the Assembly in the regular session, the enactment of penal reform legislation in the historic five day session in September have advanced the interests of our State tremendously, as well as enhancing its reputation in the eyes of those outside its borders and giving our own citizens a renewed pride in their commonwealth. I am deeply grateful for the cooperation that the Assembly has given to my Administration, and I believe that Georgia's citizens are grateful to you for your sincere patriotism and your accomplishments on behalf of our State.</p><p>I am convinced that this Assembly will dispose of the issues of votes for the men in the Army, Navy, Marine Corps and other services and for the women in the WAVES, WACS, SPARS and Marines with the same sound judgment, decisively rapid action and lofty sense of obligation to our citizens that you displayed in the past in considering other measures for the public welfare.</p><p>There can be no just opposition to permitting the soldiers to vote. Only those who deplore the bombings of Berlin and Hamburg in a spirit of mock piety, and plead for an understanding with Japan at the expense of the freedom of one of our great allies, and find extenuations for the black treachery of Hirohito and the infamy of Hitler while lashing our own national war leadership with vicious vituperation can desire that the ballot be denied to our fellow citizens whoat this very momentare fighting for our common country on every front from the mountain passes of Italy to the barren atolls of the Gilberts.</p><p>I do not wonder that the defenders of totalitarian doctrines, the advocates of dictatorship, the exponents of prejudice and distrust and hatred, the advocates of the profiteers and black market racketeers, the fellow-travelers of the Bundists and the admirers of the firm methods of Hitler and Hirohito, should be opposed to the soldiers' voting. They can expect small comfort for these theories and their advocates from the men and women in service, who have offered their blood as the price of our liberty and their living bodies as a shield for our nation against foreign proponents of these same pernicious doctrines.</p><p>But the great majority of Georgians and of Americans desire that those serving our common country, whether overseas or in training camps, be their equals and their partners in the selection of our public officials.</p><p>If we can not have confidence in the young men who are piloting Flying Fortresses and operating tanks and carrying rifles, if we can not trust the young women who have put on their country's uniform to release men for combat duty at the front, then we have nowhere to turn.</p>

<page id="GA1943.2.P130" no="GA1943.2.15" />

<p>The measure submitted to you, the members of Georgia's General Assembly, providing a method by which the voices of Georgia's men and women in our armed forces may be heard on public affairs is a reaffirmation of our faith in those who are risking their lives to preserve our way of life. By permitting these, our fellow citizens, to vote, Georgia again will have evidenced its trust in the valor and loyalty of its sons and in the courage and honor of its daughters.

PRESIDENT, MR. SPEAKER, AND</p><p>MEMBERS OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF GEORGIA:</p><p>Our country has been at war for more than two years. The men of Georgia's National Guard have been on active duty for almost four years, for the most of which time they have been on foreign assignment. Almost a quarter of a million men and women of our State are in the armed services of our country.</p><p>In 1944 we will hold a general election and party primaries of exceptional importance.</p>

<page id="GA1943.2.P153" no="GA1943.2.9" />

<p>I tell you today, it is necessary that provision be made for these men and women in the services to exercise their right to vote.</p><p>They desire to exercise that right. Their fellow citizens, by overwhelming ratification of the amendment reducing the voting age, which this General Assembly submitted to the voters last year, have expressed their determination that their sons and daughters, their brothers and sisters, who are serving our common country, shall not be disfranchised.</p><p>It is not beyond the realm of possibility that Congress may enact some measure permitting those in the services to vote for Federal officials; for electors for President and Vice-President, for Senators and for Congressmen. But such a measure, even if it were legal and were enacted speedily into law by the Congress, could not permit service men and women to vote for State and county officials. It could not provide for participation in party primaries by men and women in the services. In Georgia, the local and State primaries are usually the equivalent of election. It is in the primary that the great majority of our boys and girls overseas and in the camps wish to vote. Provision for this requires substantial changes in our election laws.</p><p>Therefore, I have asked the General Assembly of Georgia to meet and to consider and to enact legislation that will permit qualified citizens of Georgia now in the services to participate in the State elections, and that will permit qualified members of any political party to vote in the primaries held by that party.</p><p>We must recognize, however, that it will be utterly impossible to see to it that every man and woman in the military service participates in our elections. Time and distance and military secrecy are difficult to conquer. It will not be possible for American soldiers interned in Japanese prison camps to exercise their elective franchise. It will not be possible for those on duty at secret assignments in inaccessible places throughout the world to participate. But we can do our best to afford them the opportunity. We can keep the record straight.</p><p>I know that it is at no small sacrifice that the members of the General Assembly meet at this session. There are innumerable obligations at home to be fulfilled as the year begins. However, if the votes of your fellow-citizens, who are defending our common country on seven seas and upon six continents and in the air above Fortress Europe, are to be counted in the primary and the election held this year, prompt action through legislation is needed.</p><p>We have heard a great deal in recent debates in Congress, in recent speeches and articles, about State's rights.</p><p>The preservation of State's rights depends, I am convinced, upon a ready acceptance by the States of their responsibilities.</p><p>The primary responsibility of any government is the preservation of the individual rights of the citizens, of which the political and civil rights are the most important because all other rights depend upon their free exercise.</p>

<page id="GA1943.2.P154" no="GA1943.2.10" />

<p>That is the tradition in Georgia. It has been the practice in Georgia since the elections held in the days of Button Gwinnett and in the days of Archibald Bulloch. It was the practice in Georgia in the days when our nation was plunged into the desolating strife of the War Between the States.</p><p>It is a tradition solidly grounded upon firm principles. In this nation, we do not resort to the militaristic scheme of a huge standing army; we rely upon a civilian army, a citizen army; we trust in the courage and loyalty, the honor and patriotism of the youth of our nation.</p><p>The tradition of a patriotic citizenry springing to arms in the defense of the liberties that alone can make life dear is strong in Georgia. From that eventful morning when Oglethorpe's handful of colonists crushed at Bloody Marsh the trained and picked professional soldiers of Spain, through the agonies of military occupation during the Revolution that was broken through the resourcefulness and courage of Georgia irregulars, through the sad and gallant days when members of Georgia companies marked their ballots around the campfires of the Army of Northern Virginia, our State has preserved the belief that the citizen-soldier is no less citizen because he has laid aside for the moment the cap-and-gown of the scholar, the tools of the artisan or the plow of the farmer, to bear arms in defense of his home, his freedom and his honor.</p><p>Provisions for absentee voting by soldiers were simple in 1777 and 1861. The number of individuals involved was proportionately smaller than today. Generally the units were made up of men from the same State, and, in very many cases, from the same county.</p><p>Today the sons of Georgia are farther from their native land than Vicksburg or Richmond. Today they are scattered, except for those in the National Guard, and march shoulder to shoulder with boys from Vermont and Oregon and Kansas.</p><p>The simple measures, sufficient to insure their participation in the elections of 1777 and 1861, are inadequate to safeguard their voting in 1944.</p><p>But the principle remains unchanged. We must not deprive any man of his voice in our government because he has been called by that government to the supreme test of his loyalty to his country and his fellow citizens.</p><p>The honor of Georgia would be sullied, the faith of Georgia would be broken, the tradition of Georgia would be dishonored if the men driving through the perilous jungles of New Guinea, or standing sentry in the desolate wastes of Iceland, or aboard some vessel of our Navy in the Sea of Japan, should be deprived of their voice in the government of their country, their State or their nation because we took no action upon this problem.</p><p>Accordingly, I have asked the members of the General Assembly to come to our State Capital and study the question and seek a way by which the votes of our citizens absent upon high duty to our nation may be recorded.</p><p>The legislation that I believe is desired by the people of Georgia in this emergency

<page id="GA1943.2.P155" no="GA1943.2.11" />

would provide, among other things, for a simple system of registration for the members of our military so that those not now registered may easily do so. Provision should be made for moving up our primaries, elections and qualification dates where necessary, so as to afford sufficient time for the casting of ballots by men and women in service. Sufficient time should be given so that those at farstretched outposts who are qualified to participate in our primaries and elections may do so. We must abolish the poll tax as an assessment and prerequisite for voting against the men and women in the military service of our country.</p><p>It is my recommendation to the Assembly that a War Ballot Commission be created to harmonize voting laws and to serve as a tribunal to expedite and facilitate soldier voting. Such a War Ballot Commission could serve as an agency to which the Federal Government could give its cooperation in carrying out the purposes of an Act of the Georgia General Assembly providing for soldier voting. The legislation enacted should simplify absentee voting. It should provide an easy way of obtaining a ballot, and an easy way for returning it to the election holders. It is my recommendation that the proposed legislation be temporary, terminating upon the convening of the next regular General Assembly after the end of the present war.</p><p>The effect of such legislation simply would be that all persons who, if they were in their home county, could vote in a general election can vote in the general election, and that all persons who, if they were at home could vote in the primary, can vote in the primary. The legislation would not increase the number of persons eligible to vote above the number that would be eligible if they were at home instead of abroad or in a training camp. It would not reduce the qualifications for voting. It would aim at one thing and only one thing: facilitating the voting by the men and women in service, assuring them of the right of participating in the government of the country they are defending.</p><p>Such measures are in the tradition of this State, which, historians believe, probably was the first in the Nation to provide for the counting of votes by its men in the service during the period of the War Between the States. It would be peculiarly fitting for Georgia to be the first State of the Union to enact such legislation in this war.</p><p>I have emphasized the participation of the men and women now in service in the primary and in the election of State and local officers, because without action by the State through its General Assembly they could participate effectively in neither, no matter what action was taken by the Congress. However, there has been no measure enacted by Congress dealing with the votes of those in service for Federal officers. There is grave possibility that no valid, effective and constitutional legislation will be or can be enacted.</p><p>I may say that this view is shared by Georgia's distinguished Senior Senator, Walter F. George, one of the Nation's great constitutional lawyers as well as a public servant with a high sense of responsibility and lofty ideals of patriotism.</p><p>Senator George, as you know, has been deeply interested in the subject of voting by those in service. His own flesh and blood wear the uniform of our

<page id="GA1943.2.P156" no="GA1943.2.12" />

country; one of his sons already has paid the last full measure of devotion to its cause. For that reason, in part, no doubt, no less than because of his deep faith in the orderly processes of democratic government, Senator George has suggested State action as a needful safeguard to insure that the votes of Georgia service men and women reach the ballot box.</p><p>There are certain unanswerable arguments demanding that action be taken to insure the sanctity of the soldiers' ballots.</p><p>Foremost is the thesis of democratic principles. In this free nation, we believe that government exists solely by the will of the people; we believe that every citizen has a right to participate in making the laws by which we must live and in selecting the officials who shall administer those laws; we believe that the welfare of our country in time of peace can be entrusted to the votes of our people, and that its security in time of war can be maintained by their service in its cause.</p><p>We do not believe that a boy is unfit to be a citizen and a voter because he risked his life in the Salerno landing. We do not believe that a girl is unfit to be a citizen and a voter because she served her country as a grease monkey in the WAC or as a nurse in an up-front hospital or as a weather-watcher in the WAVES.</p><p>I hope that Georgia will not see the day when the uniform of our country will be the badge of disfranchisement for the man or woman who wears it.</p><p>There is likewise the vital question of the interest these young men and young womenten million in the nation, more than 200,000 of them from Georgiahave in the future of our country.</p><p>They will come back to us after the war. This is their home. This is their country. If it is a country worth dying for, it must be a country worth living in. Whether it passes through the transition period of the postwar years into a prosperous, busy nation, where individual rights are respected, depends upon the type of government that we have on every levellocal, State and nationalon the day when the war ends.</p><p>The public officials chosen this year will shape the peace. The President chosen next November and his cabinet will write the peace treaty; the Senate of which a third of the members are chosen this year will consider that treaty; the Congress chosen this year will provide the funds and levy the taxes and write the laws to implement the peace. The State Legislature chosen in the fall primary will consider the issues in our State developing in the changing world; they will even pass upon a revision of our basic constitutional law. The local officials chosen in 1944 must be the ones to handle the difficult problems of converting communities from a war basis to one of peace.</p><p>It is imperative that the men and women who serve in this war have a share in writing the peace and in shaping the postwar world.</p><p>That world will belong to their generation and to their children. They will have saved it from the menaces of foreign enemies and totalitarian ideologies. If

<page id="GA1943.2.P157" no="GA1943.2.13" />

in their absence, through injustice to them, democracy is subverted by the cynicism of us at home, by denying them the stature of free men and citizens to a vote, the consequences may well be serious.</p><p>They unquestionably will feel a deep resentment against the men and the system that denied them their rights. They will feel that the plans for America or Georgia or their home county made without their consent are not binding upon them. They will feel that they have been defrauded of their birthright while they were risking their lives to preserve our own.</p><p>Likewise, I believe that we need in public affairs the special values that these fine young men and women will bring. Although the Selective Service Act has reached to those in the thirties, the bulk of the armed forces of America, especially those serving overseas, is made up of those in their twenties together with those of the teen age group that, in Georgia, have been given the franchise.</p><p>The issues that we will confront at the ballot boxes in 1944 will be tremendously important. They involve America's place in world affairs and America's domestic policy in the postwar transition period.</p><p>Upon those issues we well may take guidance from the men and women who fight, who possess yet enthusiasm and audacity and courage and unselfishness.</p><p>Christmas morning, Mrs. Arnall, my little son and I drove to Newnan to gather around the family hearthstone. My younger brother was there, granted seven days' leave on his way to take special training for duties that shortly will carry him overseas. He was a little taller, a little broader, a little more mature than when I last saw him. With the tremendous earnestness of young men, his mind was upon two things: the job he had to do and the world he was coming back to when that job was over.</p><p>That is what all of them are thinking about, these young men that you pass every day on the street, some of them laughing and joking and others with their minds apparently off in a cloud somewhere. All of them, your sons and your younger brothers and the boy next door, and thinking about the job they've got to do and the world that they will face when they come back from doing it.</p><p>They deserve and they must have a hand in the shaping of that world.</p><p>A fitting sense of gratitude to those who have ransomed our way of living and our very lives at the cost of their comfort and their lives, demands that we give those in our country's service a voice in the management of its affairs.</p><p>The right to vote is far from complete recompense to a man who has waded ashore under a hail of machine gun bullets on some South Pacific beach head, and spent days and nights on short rations in a foxhole while Zeros droned overhead, and hacked his way through miles of tangled jungle infested by poisonous snakes, stinging insects and Jap snipers. There is neither gold enough, nor honors enough, nor medals enough to repay a man for that!</p>

<page id="GA1943.2.P158" no="GA1943.2.14" />

<p>But the knowledge that his fellow-citizens back home recognize the degree of his sacrifice, and are willing to go to the trouble to see that he is treated as a full citizen of the nation for which he fights, is the one type of repayment unworthy neither of the nation nor its heroes.</p><p>Democracy is not well served nor its cause furthered when the men fighting for its triumph are denied a share in the government of their country. One of the criticisms that the apostles of Hitler's totalitarian doctrines has leveled at the democratic countries is that they are unable to act in time of crisis, that their techniques of representative government have worn out, that legislative bodies have lost their effectiveness.</p><p>I think, in Georgia, we have given them a demonstration that this is not true. We have proved that democratic government can be efficient and that effective solutions to our problems can be found by the representatives of the people.</p><p>The accomplishments of the Georgia General Assembly during the twelve months that have just passed have been illuminating illustrations of how a democratic, constitutional, representative system can work. You have given proof that State governments can solve the problems of their citizens. The basic reforms submitted by the Assembly in the regular session, the enactment of penal reform legislation in the historic five day session in September have advanced the interests of our State tremendously, as well as enhancing its reputation in the eyes of those outside its borders and giving our own citizens a renewed pride in their commonwealth. I am deeply grateful for the cooperation that the Assembly has given to my Administration, and I believe that Georgia's citizens are grateful to you for your sincere patriotism and your accomplishments on behalf of our State.</p><p>I am convinced that this Assembly will dispose of the issue of votes for the men in the Army, Navy, Marine Corps and other services and for the women in the WAVES, WACS, SPARS and Marines with the same sound judgment, decisively rapid action and lofty sense of obligation to our citizens that you displayed in the past in considering other measures for the public welfare.</p><p>There can be no just opposition to permitting the soldiers to vote. Only those who deplore the bombings of Berlin and Hamburg in a spirit of mock piety, and plead for an understanding with Japan at the expense of the freedom of one of our great allies, and find extenuations for the black treachery of Hirohito and the infamy of Hitler while lashing our own national war leadership with vicious vituperation can desire that the ballot be denied to our fellow citizens whoat this very momentare fighting for our common country on every front from the mountain passes of Italy to the barren atolls of the Gilberts.</p><p>I do not wonder that the defenders of totalitarian doctrines, the advocates of dictatorship, the exponents of prejudice and distrust and hatred, the advocates of the profiteers and black market racketeers, the fellow-travelers of the Bundists and the admirers of the firm methods of Hitler and Hirohito, should be opposed to the soldiers' voting. They can expect small comfort for these theories and their advocates from the men and women in service, who have offered their blood as the

<page id="GA1943.2.P159" no="GA1943.2.15" />

price of our liberty and their living bodies as a shield for our nation against foreign proponents of these same pernicious doctrines.</p><p>But the great majority of Georgians and of Americans desire that those serving our common country, whether overseas or in training camps, be their equals and their partners in the selection of our public officials.</p><p>If we cannot have confidence in the young men who are piloting Flying Fortresses and operating tanks and carrying rifles, if we cannot trust the young women who have put on their country's uniform to release men for combat duty at the front, then we have nowhere to turn.</p><p>The measure submitted to you, the members of Georgia's General Assembly, providing a method by which the voices of Georgia's men and women in our armed forces may be heard on public affairs is a reaffirmation of our faith in those who are risking their lives to preserve our way of life. By permitting these, our fellow citizens, to vote, Georgia again will have evidenced its trust in the valor and loyalty of its sons and in the courage and honor of its daughters.
