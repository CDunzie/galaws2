gasoline taxes, and taxes assessed for local benefits of a kind tending to increase the value of the property assessed.</p><p>(2) In the case of Federal taxes on income, no deduction shall be allowed for taxes related, by implication or otherwise, to any retirement benefits for the person paying such tax or from whose wages such taxes are withheld. Such taxes include those popularly known as Social Security, O.A.B., or F.I.C.A. taxes, and Railroad Retirement or Carriers taxes required to be withheld from employees' wages, and taxes paid by self-employed persons, popularly known as Self-employed Social Security Tax. Those Federal taxes required to be paid by employers, which match or are similar to the taxes such employer must withhold, and the taxes popularly known as Unemployment Taxes, may be deducted by such employer only if incurred in a trade or business or in the production of taxable income.</p><p>(3) Federal income taxes shall be deducted only in the year in which paid, regardless of the method of accounting used by the taxpayer in keeping his books and records. In the case of deficiencies or additional assessments for prior years they shall be deductible in the year in which paid, provided, however, that if such deficiencies or assessments result from issues, income or deductions that would constitute a basis for assessment of income taxes by this State under its laws, said deficiencies shall be deductible, in the year in which paid, only if taxpayer waives provisions of Section 92-3303 of the Georgia Code as amended, when said section would otherwise bar the assessment and collection of such deficiencies by this State. <sidenote>Federal income taxes.</sidenote></p><p>In the event of recovery or refund of Federal income taxes, actual or constructive, such refund shall be included in gross income of the taxpayer in the taxable period in which received, regardless of the method of accounting used by the taxpayer in keeping his books and records, but only to the extent that the taxpayer received a tax benefit on the return on which such tax

In computing the ratio under this paragraph, in the case of both the Georgia and Federal net taxable incomes, the respective incomes for the taxable period to which the Federal income tax to be deducted applies shall be used.</p><p>(5) If the taxpayer is or has been a member of the armed services of the United States and by reason of his service he is or was unable to file, or does not or did not file, a return or returns with this State or the United States until his return to the United States, or under after his discharge from the armed services, he may, at his election, upon filing such returns deduct from gross income in each taxable year the amount of Federal income taxes determined to be due for such taxable year, whether or not paid within said year, provided said Federal income taxes are paid within the time prescribed by Federal law for such payment. If the State has assessed taxes without benefit of this paragraph, they shall be abated, and if collected they shall be deemed to be erroneously collected, and taxpayer shall be credited or refunded the taxes so paid provided he files claim therefor within three years from the date of last payment of such Federal income taxes. In the case of such credits or refunds, no interest shall accrue or be paid by this State.</p><p>(6) In the case of the first taxable year ending on or after February 15, 1952 a taxpayer reporting on the cash receipts and disbursements basis may deduct Federal income taxes paid within such year. For said taxable year a taxpayer reporting on the accrual basis may deduct Federal income taxes paid within such year. The purpose of this paragraph is to correct possible inequities

If a taxpayer files, or has filed, a return for the taxable period covered by this paragraph without benefit of the provisions thereof, he may file an amended return for said period in order to deduct Federal income taxes actually paid during said period, and to add back Federal income taxes accrued on the original return. If such amendment results in a deficiency of Georgia income tax, the same shall be paid by the taxpayer without interest to date of said amendment. If such amendment results in an overassessment the same shall be abated, and if paid it shall be deemed to have been erroneously collected and shall be refunded, without interest to the date claim therefor is filed. Said amended return may be filed at any time within two years from the date of passage of this Act, and not thereafter.</p><p>(7) No income taxes shall be allowed as a deduction in computing a net operating loss carry-over or carry-back as provided for in Section 92-3109 (m) of the Code of Georgia.</p><p>(8) In the case of an individual filing under the so called Federal Current Tax Payment Act he may, at his election, deduct Federal income taxes actually due as shown on the return filed with the Federal Government, from the income as reported to Georgia for the same period; provided, however, that such Federal income taxes must be actually paid to the Federal Government on or before the Federal due date, or officially extended due date.

On foreign wines, whether fortified or not, having an alcoholic content of more than 14% by volume, the excise tax shall be $1.00 per gallon</p><p>This reduction of the excise tax on domestic wines, whether fortified or not, will be in force and effect until the General Assembly convenes.</p><p>This March 5, 1949.</p><pre>Herman E.

The medical examiner may, at any time when he deems it necessary, have the body embalmed for preservation prior to release of the body to the next of kin. Such expense of embalming shall be paid in the manner hereinafter provided for payment of burial expenses. The police officer or sheriff present at such investigation, or if no officer be present, then the coroner shall, in the absence of the next of kin of the deceased person, take possession of all property of value found on such person, make an exact inventory thereof on his report and deliver such property to the sheriff of the county, who shall surrender the same to the person entitled to its custody or possession. The coroner or medical examiner shall take possession of any object or articles which, in his opinion, may be helpful in establishing the cause of death, and in cooperation with the police authorities make such tests and examinations of said objects as may be necessary or useful in determining the cause of death. In the event that a criminal prosecution arises, all such objects and articles, together with reports
