For the prevention of waste and to avoid the augmenting and accumulation of risk arising from the drilling of excessive number of wells, the Commission shall, after due investigation and a hearing, have full power and authority to establish such drilling unit or units as may, in their discretion, seem most reasonable and practicable. Said Commission shall have control of the allocation of production over such units and shall, after investigation and hearing, set up, establish and allocate to each unit its just and equitable share of production, and shall make such orders, rules and regulations as will give to each producer the opportunity to use his just and equitable share of the reservoir energy of any pool. The Commission shall have power to review and approve, or disapprove, agreements made between owners or operators, or both, in the interest of conservation of oil or gas or both or for the prevention of waste, and to do such other act as will assure just and fair dealing between lessors, lessees, producers and other interested parties. <sidenote>Power to establish drilling units to prevent waste or excessive number of wells.</sidenote></p><p>Section 14-A.

Where, however, such owners have not agreed to so integrate their interests, the Commission may, in order to prevent waste and to avoid the drilling of unnecessary wells, after notice and upon hearing, determine the feasibility of, and require, the cycling of gas in any pool or portion of a pool productive of gas from which condensate may be separated or natural gasoline extracted, and promulgate rules to unitize separate ownership and to regulate production of gas and re-introduction of gas into productive formations, after separation of condensate or extraction of natural gasoline for such gas. <sidenote>Owners may integrate their interests.</sidenote></p><p>(c) All orders requiring such integration shall be made after notice and hearing, and shall be upon terms and conditions that are just and reasonable, and will afford to the owner of each tract the opportunity to recover or receive his just and equitable share of the oil and gas in the pool without unnecessary expense, and will prevent or minimize reasonably avoidable drainage from each integrated unit which is not equalized by counter drainage. The portion of the production allocated to the owner of each tract included in an integrated unit formed by an integration order shall, when produced, be considered as if it had been produced from such tract by a well drilled thereon. In the event such integration is required, the operator designated by the Commission to develop and operate the integrated unit shall have the right to charge to each other interested owner the actual expenditures required for such purpose not in excess of what are reasonable, including charges for supervision, and the operator shall have the right to receive the first production from any well drilled by him thereon, which otherwise would be delivered or paid to the other parties jointly interested in the drilling of the well, so that the amount due by each of them for his share of the expense of drilling, equipping and operation of the well may be paid to the operator of the well

Revenue Bonds. The Authority shall have power and is hereby authorized at one time or from time to time to provide by resolution for the issuance of negotiable revenue bonds, but in no event to exceed the total sum of fifteen million dollars, of the Authority for the purpose of paying all or any part of the cost as herein-above defined of any one or more projects. The principal and interest of such revenue bonds shall be payable solely from the special fund herein provided for such payment. The bonds of each issue shall be dated, shall bear interest at such rate or rates not exceeding five per cent per annum, payable semi-annually, shall mature at such time or times as the Authority may determine at the time of issue, shall be payable in such medium of payment as to both principal and interest as may be determined by the Authority, and may be made redeemable before maturity, at the option of the Authority, at such price or prices and under such terms and conditions as may be fixed by the Authority in the resolution providing for the issuance of the bonds. The Authority shall determine the form of the bonds, including any interest coupons to be attached thereto, and shall fix the denomination or denominations of the bonds and the place or places of payment of principal and interest thereof, which may be at any bank or trust company within or without the State. In case any officer whose signature shall appear on any bonds or whose facsimile signature shall appear on any coupons cease to be such officer before the delivery of such bonds, such signature shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if he had remained in office until such delivery. All such bonds shall be signed by the Chairman of the Authority and the official seal of the Authority shall be affixed thereto and attested by the Secretary-Treasurer

<page id="GA1945.1.P466" no="GA1945.1.471" />

of the Authority and any coupons attached thereto shall bear the facsimilie signature of the Chairman of the Authority. Any coupon may bear the facsimile signature of such person and any bond may be signed, sealed and attested on behalf of the Authority by such persons as at the actual time of the execution of such bond shall be duly authorized or hold the proper office, although at the date of such bond such persons may not have been so authorized or shall not have held such office. All revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this Act shall have and are hereby declared to have all the qualities and incidents of negotiable instruments under the negotiable instruments laws of the State. Such bonds and the income thereof shall be exempt from all taxation within the State. The bonds may be issued in coupon or in registered form, or both, as the Authority may determine, and provision may be made for the registration of any coupon bond as to principal alone and also as to both principal and interest. The Authority may sell such bonds in such manner and for such price as it may determine to be for the best interests of the Authority, but no such sale shall be made at a price so low as to require the payment of interest on the money received therefor at more than five per cent per annum, computed with relation to the absolute maturity of the bonds in accordance with standard tables of bond values excluding, however, from such computation the amount of any premium to be paid on redemption of any bond prior to maturity. The proceeds of such bonds shall be used solely for the payment of the cost of the project or projects, and shall be disbursed upon requisition or order of the Chairman of the Authority under such restrictions, if any, as the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or the trust indenture hereinafter mentioned may provide. If the proceeds of such bonds, by error of calculation or otherwise, shall be less than the cost of the project or projects, unless otherwise provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust indenture, additional bonds may in like manner be issued to provide the amount of such deficit, which unless otherwise provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the

<page id="GA1945.1.P467" no="GA1945.1.472" />

trust indenture, shall be deemed to be of the same issue and shall be entitled to payment from the same fund without preference or priority of the bonds first issued for the same purpose. If the proceeds of the bonds of any issue shall exceed the amount required for the purpose for which such bonds are issued, the surplus shall be paid into the fund hereinafter provided for the payment of principal and interest of such bonds. Prior to the preparation of definitive bonds, the Authority may, under like restrictions, issue interim receipts, interim certificates or temporary bonds, with or without coupons exchangable for definitive bonds upon the issuance of the latter. The Authority may also provide for the replacement of any bond which shall become mutilated or be destroyed or lost. Such revenue bonds may be issued without any other proceedings or the happening of any other conditions or things than those proceedings, conditions and things which are specified or required by this Act. In the discretion of the Authority, revenue bonds of a single issue may be issued for the purpose of paying the cost of any one or more projects. Any resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds under the provisions of this Act shall become effective immediately upon its passage and need not be published or posted, and any such resolution may be passed at any regular or special or adjourned meeting of the Authority by a majority of its members. <sidenote>Revenue Bonds.</sidenote></p><p>Section 6. Credit of State Not Pledged. Revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this Act shall not be deemed to constitute a debt of the State of Georgia or a pledge of the faith and credit of the State, but such bonds shall be payable solely from the fund hereinafter provided therefor from earnings, and the issuance of such revenue bonds shall not directly or indirectly or contingently obligate the State to levy or to pledge any form of taxation whatever therefor from earnings, and the issuance of such revenue bonds shall not directly or indirectly or contingently obligate the State to levy or to pledge any form of taxation whatever therefor or to make any appropriation for their payment. [sic] Neither the State nor the Authority shall be obligated to pay the principal

of or the interest on such revenue bonds except from earnings of the project or projects for which they shall be issued. All such revenue bonds shall contain recitals on their face covering the foregoing provisions of this section. <sidenote>Credit of State not pledged.</sidenote></p><p>Section 7. Trust Funds. All moneys received pursuant to the Authority of this Act, whether as proceeds from the sale of revenue bonds, as grants or other contributions, or as revenues and earnings, shall be deemed to be trust funds, to be held and applied solely as provided in this Act. The Authority shall, in the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or in the trust indenture, provide for the payment of the proceeds of the sale of the bonds and the earnings and revenues to be received to any officer who, or any agency, bank or trust company, which shall act as trustee of such funds and shall hold and apply the same to the purposes hereof, subject to such regulations as this Act and such resolution or trust indenture may provide. <sidenote>Trust funds.</sidenote></p><p>Section 8. Trust Indenture. In the discretion of the Authority, any issue of such revenue bonds may be secured by a trust indenture by and between the Authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or outside of the State. Such trust indenture may pledge or assign revenues and earnings to be received. Either the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or such trust indenture may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the Authority in relation to the acquisition of property, the construction of the project, the maintenance, operation, repair and insurance of the project, and the custody, safeguarding and application of all moneys, and may also provide that any project shall be constructed and paid for under the supervision and approval of consulting engineers or architects employed or designated by the Authority and satisfactory to the original purchasers of the bonds issued therefor, and may also

<page id="GA1945.1.P469" no="GA1945.1.474" />

require that the security given by contractors and by any depositary of the proceeds of the bonds or revenues or other moneys be satisfactory to such purchasers, and may also contain provisions concerning the conditions, if any, upon which additional revenue bonds may be issued. It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of this State to act as such depositary and to furnish such indemnifying bonds or pledge such securities as may be required by the Authority. Such indenture may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee, and may restrict the individual right of action of bondholders as is customary in trust indentures securing bonds and debentures of corporations. In addition to the foregoing, such trust indenture may contain such other provisions as the Authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust indenture may be treated as a part of the cost of maintenance, operation and repair of the project or projects affected by such indenture. <sidenote>Trust indenture.</sidenote></p><p>Section 9. Agency Contracts Authorized. The Authority shall have the right to do all new construction under an agency, or construction management form of contract without the necessity of taking competitive bids. <sidenote>Contracts without competitive bids authorized.</sidenote></p><p>Section 10. Revenues and Earnings. The Authority is hereby authorized to fix and to revise from time to time fees, rentals and other charges for the use of each project and for the services and facilities furnished by the same and to charge and collect the same and to lease and to make contracts with any person, firm or corporation with respect to the use of any project or part thereof. Such rentals and other charges shall be so fixed and adjusted in respect of the aggregate thereof from the project or projects for which a single issue of revenue bonds is issued, as to provide a fund sufficient with other revenues of such project or projects, if any, to pay (a) the cost of new construction of projects, (b) the cost of maintaining, repairing and operating the project or projects, including reserves for extraordinary repairs and insurance, and other reserves required by the resolution or trust indenture,

<page id="GA1945.1.P470" no="GA1945.1.475" />

unless such cost shall be otherwise provided for, and (c) the principal of the revenue bonds and the interest thereon as the same shall become due.

The use and disposition of such sinking fund shall be subject to such regulations as may be provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the revenue bonds or in the trust indenture, but, except as may otherwise be provided in such resolution or trust indenture, such sinking fund shall be a fund for the benefit of all revenue bonds without distinction or priority of one over another. Subject to the provisions of the resolution authorizing the issuance of the revenue bonds of the trust indenture, any moneys in such sinking fund in excess of an amount equal to one year's interest on all revenue bonds then outstanding may be applied to the purchase or redemption of bonds. All revenue bonds so purchased or redeemed shall forthwith be cancelled and shall not again be issued. <sidenote>Revenues and earnings.</sidenote></p><p>It shall be the duty of the Authority to prescribe rules and regulations for the operation of each project constructed under the provisions of this Act, including rules and regulations to insure maximum use of each such project, and to impose rentals and other charges for the use of the facilities furnished by such project and to collect

But no holder of any such bond shall have the right to compel any exercise of the taxing power of the State to pay any such bond or the interest thereon, or to enforce the payment thereof against any property of the State, nor shall any such bond constitute a charge, lien or encumbrance, legal or equitable, upon any property of the State. <sidenote>Bondholders' and trustees' remedies</sidenote></p><p>Section 12.

The Authority shall have power and is hereby authorized at one time or from time to time to provide by resolution for the issuance of negotiable revenue bonds of the Authority for the purpose of paying all or any parts of the cost as hereinabove defined of any one or more projects. The principal and interest of such revenue bonds shall be payable from the special fund herein provided for such payment. The bonds of each issue shall be dated, shall bear interest at such rate or rates not exceeding five per cent per annum, payable semi-annually, shall mature at such time or times not exceeding thirty years from their date or dates, shall be payable in such medium of payment as to both principal and interest as may be determined by the Authority, and may be made redeemable before maturity, at the option of the Authority, at such price or prices and under such terms and conditions as may be fixed by the Authority in the resolution providing for the issuance of the bonds. The Authority shall determine the form of the bonds, including any interest coupons to be attached thereto, and shall fix the denomination or denominations of the bonds and the place or places of payment of principal

All such bonds shall be signed by the Chairman of the Authority and the official seal of the Authority shall be affixed thereto and attested by the Secretary-Treasurer of the Authority and any coupons attached thereto shall bear the facsimile signature of the Chairman of the Authority. Any coupon may bear the facsimile signature of such person and any bond may be signed, sealed and attested on behalf of the Authority by such persons as at the actual time of the execution of such bond shall be duly authorized or hold the proper office, although at the date of such bond such persons may not have been so authorized or shall not have held such office.

The Authority may sell such bonds in such manner for such price as it may determine to be for the best interests of the Authority, but no such sale shall be made at a price so low as to require the payment of interest on the money received therefor at more than five per cent per annum, computed with relation to the absolute maturity of the bonds in accordance with standard tables of bond values excluding, however, from such computation the amount of any premium to be paid on redemption of any bond prior to maturity. The proceeds

of such bonds shall be used solely for the payment of the cost of the project or projects, and shall be disbursed upon requisition or order of the Chairman of the Authority under such restrictions, if any, as the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or the trust indenture hereinafter mentioned may provide. If the proceeds of such bonds, by error of calculation or otherwise, shall be less than the cost of the project or projects, unless otherwise provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust indenture, additional bonds may in like manner be issued to provide the amount of such deficit, which unless otherwise provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust indenture, shall be deemed to be of the same issue and shall be entitled to payment from the same fund without preference or priority of the bonds first issued for the same purpose. If the proceeds of the bonds of any issue shall exceed the amount required for the purpose for which such bonds are issued, the surplus shall be paid into the fund hereinafter provided for the payment of principal and interest of such bonds. Prior to the preparation of definitive bonds, the Authority may, under like restrictions, issue interim receipts, interim certificates or temporary bonds, with or without coupons exchangeable for definite bonds upon the issuance of the latter. The Authority may also provide for the replacement of any bond which shall become mutilated or be destroyed or lost. Such revenue bonds may be issued without any other proceedings or the happening of any other conditions or things than those proceedings, conditions and things which are specified or required by this Act. In the discretion of the Authority, revenue bonds of a single issue may be issued for the purpose of paying the cost of any one or more projects. Any resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds under the provisions of this Act shall become effective immediately upon its passage and need not be published or posted, and any such resolution may be passed at any regular or special or adjourned meeting of the Authority by a majority of its members.</p>

Revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this Act shall not be deemed to constitute a debt of the State of Georgia or a pledge of the faith and credit of the State or of the City of Brunswick or of the County of Glynn. Such bonds may have the property, real or personal, which may from time to time be owned by the Authority pledged as security for their payment but shall not directly or indirectly or contingently obligate the State or the City of Brunswick or the County of Glynn to levy or to pledge any form of taxation whatever therefor.

The Authority shall, in the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or in the trust indenture, provide for the payment of the proceeds of the sale of the bonds and the earnings and revenues to be received to any officer who, or any agency, bank or trust company, which shall act as trustee of such funds and shall hold and apply the same to the purposes hereof, subject to such regulations as this Act and such resolution or trust indenture may provide. <sidenote>Trust funds.</sidenote></p><p>Section 8. Trust Indenture. In the discretion of the Authority, any issue of such revenue bonds may be secured by a trust indenture by and between the authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or outside of the State. Such trust indenture may pledge or assign revenues and earnings to be received and the property both real or personal owned by the Authority. Either the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or such trust indenture may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable

It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of this State to act as such depository and to furnish such indemnifying bonds or pledge such securities as may be required by the Authority. Such indenture may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee, and may restrict the individual right of action of bondholders as is customary in trust indentures securing bonds and debentures of corporations. In addition to the foregoing, such trust indenture may contain such other provisions as the Authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders.

To illustrate, if he becomes totally disabled after 11 years of service, he would be entitled to receive 11/25ths of the full pension that he would be entitled to after 25 years of service and progressively thereafter, so that if he should become disabled after 24 years of service, he would be entitled to receive 24/25ths of the pension he would be entitled to after serving 25 years, but in no event shall he receive more than 25/25ths of the amount of pension he would have received after serving 25 years. <sidenote>Total disability not in line of duty.</sidenote></p><p>Upon the death of any member or pensioner not in line of duty, his widow, if any, shall be paid during the rest of her life or until she remarries three-fourths of the pension that the member or pensioner would have been entitled to if he himself had applied for a pension at the time of his death and graduated according to the length of service of the deceased husband

To illustrate, after 5 years of service and less than 10 years of service, she would be entitled to three-fourths of 5/25ths of the full pension that her husband would have been entitled to if he had served 25 years and the illustrations as applied to the first part of this Act, as to service after 10 years, is applicable here except that the widow would only be entitled to recover three-fourths of the amount that her deceased husband would have been entitled to.

This Act was ratified and approved by the Governor on March 20, 1943, and is recorded in the Acts of the Legislature, Georgia Laws 1943, pages 401-402 and 403.</p><p>Whereas, subsequent to the passage of said Act and approval by the Governor, a test case was made involving the State Highway Department of Georgia versus Bass, one of its employees who claimed compensation under the benefits of the Act passed by the General Assembly of Georgia, and the claim was denied by the State Highway Department of Georgia on the ground that the Act was in violation of the Constitution of the State, etc.</p><p>Whereas, The Supreme Court of the State of Georgia by its decision as recorded in the 197 Georgia Reports, page 356, in the case of the State Highway Department of Georgia versus Bass, have held that the Act is constitutional in every ground of attack made upon the Act passed by the General Assembly of the State of Georgia at its regular session in 1943.</p><p>Whereas, the Supreme Court of the State in another case decided January 8, 1945, State Highway Department of Georgia versus Turner, Turner being an employee of the State Highway Department of Georgia, who was injured prior to the passage of the Act by the General Assembly in 1943, has by its recent decision again held that the Act was constitutional and that the retroactive features of the Act were not in violation of the Constitution.</p><p>Whereas, it has come to the attention of the members of the General Assembly that injured employees of the State Highway Department and other departments of

the State of Georgia are not being paid compensation, first on the ground that the Act was unconstitutional and was in violation of the Constitution of this State, second on the further ground that there was no appropriation made by the Legislature to the various departments of the State Government for the payment of said workmen's compensation claims.</p><p>Whereas, The Supreme Court in its decision in the case of State Highway Department of Georgia versus Turner, rendered January 8, 1945, held under head-note 4, and we quote:</p><p><blockquote><p>The next contention made by the Highway Department is that the act making the Highway Department amenable to the workmen's compensation law is inoperative unless and until an appropriation has been made by the General Assembly for the purpose of paying workmen's compensation and the necessary funds therefor shall be set apart by the budget commission. This ground of complaint is without merit. No question is here presented as to the manner of payment of the award, nor of the procedure to be followed by the claimant in order to collect it. It is to be presumed that should an award be made it will be paid only out of funds legally available for that purpose. See in this connection State Highway Department of Georgia v. Bass 197 Ga. 356 (4, 4a), 371.</p></blockquote></p><p>Therefore, be it resolved by the House of Representatives, the Senate concurring, that the officials of the State Government and heads of departments in charge of funds appropriated to their departments, be and are hereby instructed and directed to pay any and all compensation claims heretofore approved or adjudicated in any way under the terms of the Workmen's Compensation Act, out of the funds appropriated to the several departments of State Government, and any and all future legitimate claims which may arise as a result of injury to State employees as covered by the Workmen's Compensation Laws of Georgia. <sidenote>State employees' workmen's compensation payments directed.</sidenote></p><p>The purpose of this resolution being to direct a compliance
