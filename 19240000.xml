The said commissioners shall be selected and vacancies filled by the officers in charge of levying taxes in said counties respectively, and shall hold office for a period of five years and until their successors are selected and qualified. The bonds when issued shall be signed and sealed by said commissioners and shall be a lien upon the entire property of all of the counties composing said district, and a first lien to the extent of the annual retirements and interest payments thereon upon any sums payable annually hereafter by the State of Georgia to the said counties respectively from amounts collected from gasoline and oil taxes until all bonds of said district are retired.

<p><list><item><p>(1) When it is expressed to be so payable; or</p></item><item><p>(2) When it is payable to a person named therein or bearer; or</p></item><item><p>(3) When it is payable to the order of a fictitious or non-existing person, and such fact was known to the person making it so payable; or</p></item><item><p>(4) When the name of the payee does not purport to be the name of any person; or</p></item><item><p>(5) When the only or last indorsement is an indorsement in blank.</p></item></list></p><p>Sec. 10. (<i>Terms, When Sufficient</i>.) The instrument need not follow the language of this Act, but any terms are sufficient which clearly indicate an intention to conform to the requirements thereof. <sidenote>Form.</sidenote></p><p>Sec. 11. (<i>Date; Presumption as to</i>.) Where the instrument or an acceptance or any indorsement thereon is dated, such date is deemed prima facie to be the true date of the making, drawing, acceptance, or indorsement, as the case may be. <sidenote>Date.</sidenote></p><p>Sec. 12. (<i>Ante-dated and Post-dated</i>.) The instrument is not invalid for the reason only that it is ante-dated or post-dated, provided this is not done for an illegal or fraudulent purpose. The person to whom an instrument so dated is delivered acquires the title thereto as of the date of delivery. <sidenote>Post-dated. antedated.</sidenote></p><p>Sec. 13.

Where an instrument expressed to be payable at a fixed period after date is issued undated, or where the acceptance of an instrument payable at a fixed period after sight is undated, any holder may insert therein the true date of issue or acceptance, and the instrument shall be payable accordingly. The insertion of a wrong date does not avoid the instrument in the hands of a subsequent holder in due course; but as to him, the date so inserted is to be regarded as a true date. <sidenote>Insertion of date.</sidenote></p><p>Sec. 14. (<i>Blanks; When May Be Filled</i>.) Where the instrument is wanting in any material particular, the person in possession thereof has a prima facie authority to complete it by filling up the blanks therein. And a signature on a blank

<page id="GA1924.1.P127" no="GA1924.1.130" />

paper delivered by the person making the signature in order that the paper may be converted into a negotiable instrument operates as a prima facie authority to fill it up as such for any amount. In order, however, that any such instrument when completed may be enforced against any person who became a party thereto prior to its completion, it must be filled up strictly in accordance with the authority given and within a reasonable time. But if any such instrument, after completion, is negotiated to a holder in due course, it is valid and effectual for all purposes in his hands, and he may enforce it as if it had been filled up strictly in accordance with the authority given and within a reasonable time. <sidenote>Authority to fill blanks.</sidenote> <sidenote>Enforcement where blank filled without authority. See 17 Ga. App. 178.</sidenote></p><p>Sec. 15. (<i>Incomplete Instrument not Delivered</i>.) Where an incomplete instrument has not been delivered, it will not, if completed and negotiated without authority, be a valid contract, in the hands of any holder, as against any person whose signature was placed thereon before delivery. <sidenote>Unauthorized completion and negotiation of undelivered paper.</sidenote></p><p>Sec. 16. (<i>Delivery; When Effectual; When Presumed</i>.) Every contract on a negotiable instrument is incomplete and revocable until delivery of the instrument for the purpose of giving effect thereto. As between immediate parties, and as regards a remote party other than a holder in due course, the delivery, in order to be effectual, must be made either by or under the authority of the party making, drawing, accepting or indorsing, as the case may be; and in such case the delivery may be shown to have been conditional, or for a special purpose only, and not for the purpose of transfering the property in the instrument. But where the instrument is in the hands of a holder in due course, a valid delivery thereof by all parties prior to him so as to make them liable to him is conclusively presumed. And where the instrument is no longer in possession of a party whose signature appears thereon, a valid and intentional delivery by him is presumed until the contrary is proved. <sidenote>Conditional delivery.</sidenote> <sidenote>Presumption of delivery.</sidenote></p><p>Sec. 17. (<i>Construction Where Instrument is Ambiguous</i>.) Where the language of the instrument is ambiguous or there

are omissions therein, the following rules of construction apply: <sidenote>Rules of construction.</sidenote></p><p><list><item><p>(1) Where the sum payable is expressed in words and also in figures and there is a discrepancy between the two, the sum denoted by the words is the sum payable; but if the words are ambiguous or uncertain, reference may be had to the figures to fix the amount; <sidenote>Conflict of words and figures.</sidenote></p></item><item><p>(2) Where the instrument provides for the payment of interest without specifying the date from which interest is to run, the interest runs from the date of the instrument, and if the instrument is undated, from the issue thereof; <sidenote>Interest where date is omitted.</sidenote></p></item><item><p>(3) Where the instrument is not dated, it will be considered to be dated as of the time it was issued. <sidenote>Date omitted.</sidenote></p></item><item><p>(4) Where there is a conflict between the written and printed provisions of the instrument, the written provisions prevail; <sidenote>Conflict of print and writing.</sidenote></p></item><item><p>(5) Where the instrument is so ambiguous that there is doubt whether it is a bill or a note, the holder may treat it as either at his election. <sidenote>Doubt as to nature of paper.</sidenote></p></item><item><p>(6) Where a signature is so placed upon the instrument that it is not clear in what capacity the person making the same is intended to sign, he is to be deemed an indorser. <sidenote>Signer deemed indorser when.</sidenote></p></item><item><p>(7) Where an instrument containing the words I promise to pay is signed by two or more persons, they are deemed to be jointly and severally liable thereon. <sidenote>Joint and several liability.</sidenote></p></item></list></p><p>Sec. 18. (<i>Liability of Person Signing in Trade or Assumed Name</i>.) No person is liable on the instrument whose signature does not appear thereon, except as herein otherwise expressly provided. But one who signs in a trade or assumed name will be liable to the same extent as if he had signed in his own name. <sidenote>Signature in assumed or trade name.</sidenote></p><p>Sec. 19. (<i>Signature by Agent; Authority, how shown</i>.) The signature of any party may be made by a duly authorized agent. No particular form of appointment is necessary for this purpose; and the authority of the agent may be established as in other case of agency. <sidenote>Agent's authority to sign, how shown.</sidenote></p>

<page id="GA1924.1.P129" no="GA1924.1.132" />

<p>Sec. 20. (<i>Liability of Person signing as Agent, etc</i>.) Where the instrument contains or a person adds to his signature words indicating that he signs for or on behalf of a principal, or in a representative capacity, he is not liable on the instrument if he was duly authorized, but the mere addition or words describing him as an agent, or as filling a representative character, without disclosing his principal, does not exempt him from personal liability. <sidenote>Agent's liability.</sidenote></p><p>Sec. 21. (<i>Signature by Procuration; Effect of</i>.) A signature by procuration operates as a notice that the agent has but a limited authority to sign, and the principal is bound only in case the agent in so signing acted within the actual limits of his authority. <sidenote>Signing by procuration.</sidenote></p><p>Sec. 22. (<i>Effect of Indorsement by Infant or Corporation</i>.) The indorsement or the assignment of the instrument by a corporation or by an infant passes the property therein, not-withstanding that from want of capacity the corporation or infant may incur no liability thereon. <sidenote>Indorsement by infant or corporation.</sidenote></p><p>Sec. 23. (<i>Forged Signature; Effect of</i>.) When a signature is forged or made without the authority of the person whose signature it purports to be, it is wholly inoperative, and no right to retain the instrument, or to give a discharge therefor, or to enforce payment thereof against any party thereto, can be acquired through or under such signature, unless the party against whom it is sought to enforce such right is precluded from setting up the forgery or want of authority. <sidenote>Signature unauthorized, effect of.</sidenote> <sidenote>C.

(<i>Consideration, what constitutes</i>.) Value is any consideration sufficient to support a simple contract. An

Where value has at any time been given for the instrument, the holder is deemed a holder for value in respect to all parties who became such prior to that time. <sidenote>Holder for value, who is.</sidenote></p><p>Sec. 27. (<i>When lien on Instrument Constitutes Holder for Value</i>.)

C.  4289.</sidenote></p><p>Sec. 28. (<i>Effect of Want of Consideration</i>.) Absence or failure of consideration is matter of defense as against any person not a holder in due course; and partial failure of consideration is a defense pro tanto, whether the failure is an ascertained and liquidated amount or otherwise. <sidenote>Failure of consideration.</sidenote></p><p>Sec. 29. (<i>Liability of Accommodation Party</i>.) An accommodation party is one who has signed the instrument as maker, drawer, acceptor or indorser, without receiving value therefor, and for the purpose of lending his name to some other person. Such a person is liable on the instrument to a holder for value, notwithstanding such holder at the time of taking the instrument knew him to be only an accommodation party. <sidenote>Accommodation party.</sidenote></p></div><div><title>ARTICLE III.<br set="CENTER">NEGOTIATION.<br set="CENTER" /></br></title><p>Sec. 30. (<i>What Constitutes Negotiation</i>.) An instrument is negotiated when it is transferred from one person to another in such manner as to constitute the transferee the holder thereof. If payable to bearer, it is negotiated by delivery; if payable to order, it is negotiated by the indorsement of the holder, completed by delivery. <sidenote>Meaning of negotiated.</sidenote> <sidenote>C.

<page id="GA1924.1.P131" no="GA1924.1.134" />

<p>Sec. 32. (<i>Indorsement must be of entire instrument</i>.) The indorsement must be an indorsement of the entire instrument. An indorsement which purports to transfer to the indorsee a a part only of the amount payable, or which purports to transfer the instrument to two or more indorsees severally, does not operate as a negotiation of the instrument. But where the instrument has been paid in part, it may be indorsed as to the residue. <sidenote>Indorsement of part.</sidenote></p><p>Sec. 33. (<i>Kinds of Indorsement</i>.) An indorsement may be either special or in blank; and it may also be either restrictive, or qualified, or conditional. <sidenote>Modes of indorsing.</sidenote></p><p>Sec. 34. (<i>Special Indorsement; Indorsement in Blank</i>.) A special indorsement specifies the person to whom, or to whose order the instrument is to be payable; and the indorsement of such indorser is necessary to the further negotiation of the instrument. An indorsement in blank specifies no indorser, and an instrument so indorsed is payable to bearer, and may be negotiated by delivery. <sidenote>Special indorsement.</sidenote> <sidenote>Blank indorsement.</sidenote></p><p>Sec. 35. (<i>Blank Indorsement; How Changed to Special Indorsement</i>.)

This notice must be mailed to the defendant at his last known post-office address. If such person shall appear and shall submit evidence, showing to the satisfaction of the commission, that the levy was excessive, or that there was some error or default in the procedure, or if the commission shall, after consideration and without any appearance by the person notified, decide that such levy was excessive or that error was committed in the procedure, then the commission shall direct the levying officer to dismiss the levy already made, and to make a new levy only on so much of said property as shall be reasonably sufficient to pay the amount of the execution and all cost, or to correct the errors committed in making such levy or sale, or both, which order shall be obeyed by the levying officers and all other officers and employees of said city.
