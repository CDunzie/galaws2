Such contributions shall be made by DeKalb County for a period of five years following the effective date of this Act. Within sixty (60) days prior to the end of such five-year period, it shall be the duty of the governing authority of DeKalb County to employ some qualified actuary or firm of actuaries to analyze the DeKalb County pension plan and report thereon to the pension board, should the contribution to the plan herein provided to be made by DeKalb County be found to be insufficient to maintain the plan on a sound basis, it shall be the duty of such

governing authority of DeKalb to appropriate such further sum for the next five years as would be necessary to maintain the fund and the plan on a sound basis. Should the actuary or firm of actuaries find that a lesser contribution by DeKalb County would maintain the fund and the plan on a sound basis, DeKalb County is authorized to decrease its contribution to the percentage of the total payroll found by the actuary or firm of actuaries to be sufficient to maintain the plan and the fund on such sound basis. The pension plan shall be actuarially reviewed every five years in the manner herein set forth.
