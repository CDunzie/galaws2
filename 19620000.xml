<page id="GA1962.3.P4" no="GA1962.3.4" />

<p>Whereas: As pointed out by the Court, such reapportionment may be achieved most feasibly with respect to the State Senate; and</p><p>Whereas: The people of Georgia, acting by and through their General Assembly, possess the innate capability of resolving their governmental problems without the intervention of the federal judiciary; and</p><p>Whereas: The consideration of comity arising from the delicate problems of federal-state relations under the federal system demand that this grave issue be resolved by the people's chosen representatives in keeping with the Democratic principles incident to a Republican form of government; and</p><p>Whereas: Other urgent problems have also arisen concerning administration under the State Toll Bridge Authority Act which problems require immediate legislative consideration; and</p><p>Now, therefore: Upon consideration of the premises stated, and under and by virtue of the power and authority vested in me by the Constitution of Georgia, Article V, Section I, Paragraph XII, I, S. Ernest Vandiver, Governor of Georgia, do hereby convoke and call a meeting of the General Assembly of Georgia in extraordinary session at 11:00 A.M., Eastern Standard Time, on Thursday, September 27, 1962, for the purposes of considering and enacting laws and proposed constitutional amendments by way of revision, repeal, supersession, enactment, amendment or otherwise relating to (1) nomination and election of Senators, the composition and reapportionment of the Senate; the creation, composition, reconstitution and rearrangement of Senatorial Districts; (2) the Constitutional corporate existence, powers and duties of the State Toll Bridge Authority, as created by an Act approved March 2, 1953 (Ga. Laws 1953, Jan. and Feb. Sess., p. 302), all of which are found and concluded by me to be of sufficient importance to demand the necessity of such extraordinary session of the General Assembly.</p>

ERNEST VANDIVER OF THE STATE OF GEORGIA CONVENING THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF GEORGIA IN EXTRAORDINARY SESSION</p></preface><p>Whereas: On September 14, 1962, an Executive Proclamation was duly issued convening the General Assembly in extraordinary session on September 27, 1962, for the purpose of considering and enacting laws and proposed constitutional amendments by way of revision, repeal, supersession, enactment, amendment or otherwise, relating to (1) nomination and election of Senators, the composition and reapportionment of the Senate; the creation, composition, reconstitution and rearrangement of Senatorial Districts; (2) the Constitutional corporate existence, powers and duties of the State Toll Bridge Authority as created by an Act approved March 2, 1953 (Ga. Laws 1953, Jan. and Feb. Sess., p. 302); and</p><p>Whereas: Subsequent to the issuance of said Proclamation, it has been brought to my attention that the acquisition of right of ways by the State Highway Department of

<page id="GA1962.3.P6" no="GA1962.3.6" />

Georgia is being impeded and seriously curtailed as a result of certain legal defects in the eminent domain statues of this State; and</p><p>Whereas: Subsequent to the issuance of said Proclamation, it has also been brought to my attention that an Act passed by the General Assembly at its 1962 regular session providing for funds to municipalities to construct and maintain streets (Ga. Laws 1962, p. 641) is defective in certain material aspects, as a result of which the various municipalities of this State are prohibited from receiving funds from the State which have been previously designated for said purposes; and</p><p>Whereas: It is, therefore, deemed appropriate that the General Assembly at the extraordinary session heretofore called by me be afforded an opportunity to consider pertinent legislation to revise or amend the several eminent domain statutes of this State in order that the road building program of this State might proceed without further unnecessary delays; and</p><p>Whereas: It is also deemed appropriate that the General Assembly at the extraordinary session heretofore called by me be afforded an opportunity to consider legislation providing for grants to incorporated municipalities of this State for the purpose of aiding in the construction and maintenance of streets and providing personnel and equipment to control and accommodate the flow of traffic therein, in order that said municipalities may receive without further delay funds which have previously been appropriated and designated for said purposes;</p><p>Now, therefore: Pursuant to and by virtue of power and authority vested in me by the Constitution of Georgia, Article V, Section I, Paragraph XII, I, S. Ernest Vandiver, Governor of Georgia, do hereby amend the Proclamation heretofore issued on September 14, 1962, by adding thereto, immediately following the next to the last paragraph, the following:</p><p><blockquote><p>(1) Said extraordinary session is also called for the
