Extension of Urban Services; Expansion of Urban Area.</b> As soon as practicable after its organization and from time to time thereafter, the Governing Authority shall determine what service or services being then rendered in the Urban Area it may be economically feasible to render in an area or areas outside the Urban Area. The Governing Authority shall define the limits of any such area so as to include only properties which they find to be substantially similar as to need for such proposed service or services, giving consideration to any variance in purposes for which particular properties may be used. Each area in which it is proposed that such additional urban services may be rendered shall be in one geographical body contiguous to the boundaries of the Urban Area or contiguous to the boundaries of an area to which such service or services have been previously extended. The Governing Authority may offer different services to different areas at the same time.

Such resolution shall be published at least once in the newspaper designated the official organ of Macon Bibb County. Any registered and qualified voter residing in such area who disapproves of such proposal may at any time within sixty days after the date of publication of such resolution file singly or jointly with other registered and qualified voters of such area in writing his objection to such proposal with the Ordinary of Macon Bibb County. The form of such objection shall first identify the area, the service offered and the resolution, and specify Against the resolution. The objection shall be signed by and bear the residence address of such registered and qualified voter.</p><p>During the sixty-day period the Ordinary shall safely

If fewer than twentyfive per cent of the registered and qualified voters in any area have disapproved the proposed resolution, the Ordinary shall so certify to the Governing Authority, and the proposed resolution shall be effective thirty days from the date of the certificate of the Ordinary. If twenty-five percent or more of the registered and qualified voters in any area affected by the resolution shall have indicated their disapproval of the proposed resolution, then, and in such event, the Ordinary shall so certify to the Governing Authority as soon as practicable, and said resolution shall not go into effect, but the Ordinary shall thereupon call an election within ten days from the certification aforesaid, such election to be held not earlier than thirty nor later than sixty days after such call. The Ordinary shall prepare ballots in an appropriate form, and the issue of whether said resolution shall go into effect shall in said election be submitted to the qualified and registered voters residing in the affected area. If at such election a majority of the registered and qualified voters of the area described in the resolution voting in said election approve the said resolution the same shall go into effect immediately. In the event said proposal is rejected in such election, it shall not again be proposed for a period of five years thereafter. In any event, however, the Governing Authority may in its discretion within the aforesaid ten-day period notify the Ordinary not to call such election, in which event said proposal shall be treated as withdrawn and shall not again be proposed without a new finding and notice as above provided.

It shall be the duty of every person, firm or corporation owning real or personal property within the limits of Macon Bibb County which is subject to taxation, to make returns thereof to the Tax Commissioner on or before March 31st of each year. All such property shall be returned at its fair market value on a form prescribed by said Commissioner and sworn to by the owner, his agent, or person making such returns.

The Governing Authority is hereby further authorized and empowered to require all railroads and railroad companies to construct, repair or reconstruct, at their own expense, such culverts, drainage pipes and other drainage structures across their rights of way or under their tracks and roadbeds anywhere within the limits of Macon Bibb County whenever the Governing Authority shall by resolution declare that such construction or installation of pipes, culverts or other drainage structures are necessary in the interest of the public health, safety and welfare of Macon Bibb County. It shall also be the duty of railroads and railroad companies having bridges or underpasses constructed, or when they may hereafter construct bridges or underpasses across or under their tracks and roadbeds, where the same cross the public roads or streets of Macon Bibb County, to keep said bridges, underpasses and approaches thereto and the foundations, pillars and supports thereof, in safe condition so as to admit of comfortable travel on any such road or street.

In case of any failure of any railroad or railroad company, after reasonable notice so to do, to build or repair any bridge or underpass or the approaches thereto, or to install, construct, repair or reconstruct any drainage structure as herein provided, or properly to maintain the same, the Governing Authority shall have the power to do such building, repairing or putting into safe and suitable and comfortable condition such bridge, underpass, the approaches thereto, or a drainage structure, at the expense, with interest and costs, of such railroad or railroad company, for which expenses execution shall issue as other executions are issued by the Governing Authority and be levied on any property of such railroad or railroad company; provided, further, that said Governing Authority shall have the power and authority by ordinance or resolution to declare any structure, bridge, bridges, underpass or underpasses of a railroad company or companies a nuisance when they shall determine that the same shall need repair, shall be unsafe, or shall in any manner interrupt or interfere with the public safety or convenience, and shall have the power and authority to order any such structure, bridge, or underpass to be repaired, removed, or reconstructed in accordance with such plans and specifications and with such materials and in such time and manner as may be prescribed by said Governing Authority; provided, further, that if any railroad or railroad company shall fail to comply after reasonable notice, and to build, repair, or reconstruct any such structure, bridge, or underpass, or the approaches thereto, or otherwise as above provided, or shall fail to build, repair, or reconstruct the bridge, underpass, or approaches thereto, or any other structure, according to the plans and specifications prescribed

Default in the payment of any one of the installments due shall mature the remaining installments. Nothing herein contained shall be construed as giving the Governing Authority power to incur indebtedness to be paid from its Treasury on account of such construction, which indebtedness is not to be paid in the year in which it is contracted. Any notes executed under the provisions hereof may be transferred to any person, firm, or corporation, which transfer shall be made in obedience to an ordinance of the Governing Authority, and shall be in writing on such notes, signed by the Chairman ex-officio Mayor. Such notes, when transferred, shall convey to the owner thereof all right, title, and interest in and to the notes and to the assessments and liens upon the respective properties, with full power to enforce collection thereof to the same extent as could the Governing Authority.
