And whenever such encroachments are along or upon such street, alley, lane, walk or square already laid out, then no compensation shall be made for the removal of the same.

A majority of the arbitrators can make the award. The submission shall be in writing, and the return shall be filed in the office of the clerk of the superior court of Turner County within ten days after it is made, and the appeal can be entered within ten days after the filing of the award. The arbitrators shall be sworn to make a just and true assessment of the damages, considering the value of the land and benefits the owner is to receive from the opening or otherwise changing said street. If the owner of such land refuses to act, or is a minor, or is insane, upon the fact being shown to the ordinary of Turner County, he may appoint the arbitrator for such owner. The award when so filed and not appealed from shall be the judgment of the superior court of Turner County, and execution may at once issue upon the same for the amount thereof, as other executions are issued. In case of appeal as above provided

In the event the city of Ashburn is not dissatisfied with said award, it shall pay to the clerk of the superior court the amount so found to be due by said arbitrators. If the city is dissatisfied, and the appeal is entered by it, it shall give bond, with security, for the payment of the amount adjudged to be due by it on the final hearing of said case. Should no appeal be entered within ten days, and the city of Ashburn should fail or refuse to pay the amount of the award, and should proceed with the work, then the clerk shall, upon the application of the owner, or ordinary, when he is authorized to act, issue exception on said award, and proceedings thereon shall be the same as had in cases of judgments and executions in the superior court of Turner County. But the city of Ashburn shall have the right, after said award is filed, to abandon its purpose of widening, extending, straightening, laying out, opening or establishing said street, alley, lane, walk or square, in the event the mayor and city council should consider that the sum found to be due would, in their judgment, make said lands so sought to be condemned too expensive to said city. But in such event said city shall pay all costs of said award.

Any elector who is entitled to receive assistance in the voting shall select any elector, except a poll manager or clerk, who is qualified to vote in the election. However, no person shall assist more than five electors in any one election. An elector who is able to go to the place of holding the election but is unable to enter the confines of the polling place, may mark a ballot carried to him by the manager or assistant manager, but at a distance not to exceed 200 feet from the polling place; and after the ballot is marked by the disabled elector, he shall hand the same to the manager, who shall remain in the presence of the disabled elector while he marks his ballot, and the manager shall place the same in the ballot box.</p></item><item><p>(h) Any absentee elector, including those who will be unable to attend the polling place on election day due to physical disability, or such elector's father, mother, wife, brother, sister, aunt, uncle, daughter or son of the age of 18 or over may, not more than 30 days prior to the date of an election the elector desires to vote in, make written and signed application to the city clerk for an official absentee ballot.

The applicant shall then return the ballot in a sealed envelope, marked `Ballot' with the applicant's name thereon, to the city clerk or by mail or personal delivery. The city clerk, upon receipt of envelopes containing ballots, shall leave the envelopes sealed, and on the day of the election, and before the closing of the polls, deliver all absentee ballots to the managers of the election. The managers shall immediately determine from the official registration list whether the absentee elector's names are

thereon, and not marked as having voted in person. If said absentee electors have voted in person, his or their absentee ballot shall be returned to said elector or electors by mail or personal delivery. If said absentee electors have not voted in person, their names shall be stricken on the official registration list and their ballots shall then be placed in the ballot box. Any elector may, in person, request that his ballot be returned to him, and if it has not already been placed in the ballot box, it shall be returned to him; if it has already been placed in the ballot box, when the ballot box is opened, it shall be removed and returned to him and not counted. In the event that an elector appears to vote in person, who has filed an absentee ballot, he shall be allowed to vote, and upon opening the ballot box, his absentee ballot shall be removed, not counted, and returned to him. Any envelope containing ballots delivered to the managers after the polls have closed shall be left unopened and returned to the absentee elector. Any envelopes containing ballots delivered to the manager unsealed or otherwise not in strict compliance with the foregoing provisions shall be returned to the absentee electors. In the event that any absentee voter shall have died since marking and mailing his ballot, said ballot shall be returned to his last known address.</p></item><item><p>(i) If an elector's right to vote is challenged for cause, before depositing the same in the ballot box, the manager shall write `Challenged', the elector's name and the alleged cause of challenge on the back of the ballot, or if an absentee ballot, on the back of the envelope containing the same, and then on the ballot when the envelope is opened.</p></item><item><p>(j) Upon the closing of the polls, all remaining unused ballots shall be placed in a suitable container and the container sealed. The ballot boxes will then be opened and the managers and clerks shall proceed to count and tally the ballots. All votes shall be counted, unless the intention of the voter cannot be reasonably determined, and the manager shall make the final decision as to whether a vote shall be counted. If a vote for a candidate for an office on the ballot is rendered void for any reason, it shall not invalidate the votes cast on the remainder of the ballot

<page id="GA1967.2.P842" no="GA1967.2.2841" />

if otherwise properly marked. A return of the count shall be prepared by the manager and assistant manager, showing the name of all candidates, including write-in candidates, and the office for which they were candidates, with the total votes received by each. The return shall be certified to by the manager and assistant manager as a true and correct return of the election results, and delivered to the city clerk for the official files of the city, and said return shall be open and available to the public for inspection. The manager and assistant manager shall issue and sign a certificate of election, indicating the names of those candidates who were elected to the various offices to be filled in the election, and deliver the same to the city clerk for the official files of the city.</p><p>Upon completion of the count and after the certificates provided for are prepared and completed, all ballots, including unused ballots, the official registration list used in the election, application for absentee ballots, envelopes in which absentee ballots were received and not returned, a copy of the certified return and a copy of the certificate of election, and all other writings or papers used in the conduct of the election, shall be placed in the ballot box, and the ballot box re-sealed and delivered to the ordinary of Randolph County. Said ballot box or boxes shall remain sealed and unopened until 30 days from the date of the election, at which time the box and contents may be destroyed, unless a contest to the election is filed, in which case the box and contents may be destroyed upon the termination of the contest and upon the order of the presiding judge in the election contest.</p></item><item><p>(k) In the event that any dispute or disagreement shall arise between the managers, candidates, or anyone else, as to the conduct of the election, counting of the ballots, filing of certificates, or the interpretation of the foregoing provisions and general laws of Georgia that may apply, the decision of the manager shall be final and conclusive, except that the manager's decision shall not deprive a disputant nor anyone else of his right to contest the elections as provided by the charter of the City of Coleman.</p></item>

<page id="GA1967.2.P843" no="GA1967.2.2842" />

<item><p>(l) No candidate shall be elected to the office of mayor in any election unless such candidate shall have received a majority of the votes cast to fill such office. In the event that no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast for mayor, a run-off election shall be held between the two candidates receiving the highest number of votes, unless there are more than two candidates receiving the highest number of votes, in which case run-off elections shall be held until one candidate receives a majority of votes cast in such election. The first run-off election shall be held not less than ten and not more than twenty days following the date of the first regular or special election, and the candidate receiving the majority of the votes cast in such run-off election to fill the office of mayor shall be declared the winner. In the event that more than one run-off election is necessary, such elections subsequent to the first run-off election shall be held not less than ten and not more than twenty days following the previous run-off election. Such run-off election, or elections, shall be held and conducted as herein provided for regular elections, except that the notice of such election shall be given at least five days before the date of said election.</p><p>The five candidates receiving the highest number of votes cast for the office of councilmen shall be declared winners. In the event that there are tie votes resulting in more than five candidates receiving the five highest number of votes, a run-off election shall be held between those candidates receiving the lowest number of votes among the five highest numbers, and who are tied. Subsequent run-off elections shall be held, if necessary, in order to elect five councilmen. The first run-off election shall be held not less than ten and not more than twenty days following the regular or special election, and subsequent run-off elections, if necessary, shall be held not less than ten and not more than twenty days following the previous run-off election. Said run-off election shall be held under the same rules and regulations as hereinbefore provided, except that notice of such election shall be given as required at least five days before the date of such election.</p></item>

Such recount shall be held within three days after such application, and shall be conducted by said mayor and council, and the result declared and certified to upon recount by said mayor and council shall be final.</p><p>In such event, the ballot box, or boxes, shall be opened and the recount conducted in the presence of the ordinary of Randolph County. The results of the recount shall be put in writing and certified to by the mayor and council and the ordinary.

If the result of the election is changed, and candidates other than those previously declared elected, are determined to have been elected, or if the recount determines that there were tie votes preventing a candidate from having been elected as previously declared, the certificate shall so state. Whereupon the certificate shall be delivered to the city clerk for the official records of the city, and if the new election, or run-off election, is required, the same shall be held not less than ten days and not more than twenty days following the date of the recount, and notice of the same shall be given as required not less than five days prior to the date of said election.

It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of this State to act as such depositary and to furnish such indemnifying bonds or pledge such securities as may be required by the Authority. Such indenture may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders as is customary in trust indentures securing bonds and debentures of corporations. In addition to the foregoing, such trust indenture may contain such other provisions as the Authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out such

Same; sinking funds</b>. The revenues, fees, tolls and earnings derived from any particular project or projects, regardless of whether or not such have been issued, unless otherwise pledged and allocated, may be pledged and allocated by the Authority to the payment of the principal and interest on revenue bonds of the Authority as the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust instrument may provide, and such funds not pledged, from whatever source received, which said pledge may include funds received from one or more or all sources, shall be set aside at regular intervals as may be provided in the resolution or trust indenture, into a sinking fund which said sinking fund shall be pledged to and charged with the payments of (1) the interest upon such revenue bonds as such interest shall fall due, (2) the principal of the bonds as the same shall fall due, (3) the necessary charges of paying agents for paying principal and interest, and (4) any premium upon bonds retired by call or purchase as hereinabove provided.

The petition for validation shall also make party defendant to such action any municipality, county, authority, subdivision, or instrumentality of the State of Georgia which has contracted with the Authority for services and facilities of the water system for which bonds are to be issued and sought to be validated, and such municipality, county, authority, subdivision, or instrumentality shall be required to show cause, if any, why such contract or contracts and the terms and conditions thereof should not be inquired into by the Court and the validity of the terms thereof be determined and the contract or contracts adjudicated as security for the payment of any such bonds of the Authority. The bonds, when validated, and the judgment of validation shall be final and conclusive with respect to such bonds, against the Authority issuing the same, and any municipality, county, authority, subdivision or instrumentality contracting with the said Walker County Rural Water and Sewer Authority.</p><p><b>Section 22. Same; interest of bondholders protected</b>. While any of the bonds issued by the Authority remain outstanding, the powers, duties or existence of said Authority or of its officers, employees, or agents, shall not be diminished or impaired in any manner that will affect adversely the interests and rights of the holders of such bonds, and no other entity, department, agency, or authority, will be created which will compete with the Authority to such an extent as to affect adversely the rights and interests of the holders of such bonds, nor will the State itself so compete with the Authority.
