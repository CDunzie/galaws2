The managers shall compare ballot-labels on the machine with the sample ballots, see that they are correct, examine and see that all the counters except protective counters are set at naught or zero (0) and that the machine or machines are otherwise in perfect order. If upon such inspection it be found that the voting machine has not been properly prepared for the election, or is not in perfect order, the said officer or officers charged in this Act with the duty of the preparation of such machine shall be notified immediately; after provision shall have been made for the use of a machine or machines as will enable the managers of the election to properly conduct the same, or after provision shall have been made for the use of written or printed ballots, the election shall proceed.

The managers of election shall, upon notice from the said commission, attend any meeting or meetings called for their instruction and receive such instructions as shall be necessary for the proper conduct of the elections with the machine or machines. No manager of election shall serve in any election at which a voting machine or machines are used, unless he shall have received such instructions and is fully qualified to perform his duties in connection with the machine; provided, however, that this shall not prevent the appointment or serving of a manager of election to fill a vacancy arising on the day of election. The compensation of said managers of election shall be as prescribed by said commission.

When Write-in ballots have been voted they shall be returned, preserved and finally destroyed as is now provided by law in the case of other election ballots. The written certificate so made, after having been properly certified and signed, shall be distinctly and clearly read in the hearing of all persons present, and ample opportunity shall be given to compare the results so certified with the registering counters of the machine or machines. After such comparison and correction, if any is made, the election managers shall then close the registering compartment and lock the same. Thereafter the machine or machines shall remain locked and sealed for a period of at least thirty days: Provided, however, that should the use of same be required at any election to be held within said thirty day period, the machine or machines may be opened at least ten days prior to the date of such subsequent election; Provided, further, that same may be opened at any time upon order of a court of competent jurisdiction.<sidenote>Same.</sidenote></p><p>Section 19.

Said petition shall allege that the ordinance is authorized by law, and that it will create a lien on all real property abutting on such street or part of a street, for the payment by the owner of each lot or parcel of land so abutting, of the pro rata share of expense assessed to each said or parcel of land, as well as on any street or other railroad therein, if any such there be, and shall pray for a judgment by the court declaring such ordinance valid, legal, and binding, and that the liens be set up as alleged. It shall not be necessary in such petition to allege the names of the owners of the abutting property or railroads to affected, but it shall be sufficient to describe the street or portion thereof to be improved, and to indicate, as hereinbefore provided, that the property on said street is to be charged with the expense.<sidenote>Legality of ordinances, how tested.</sidenote></p></blockquote></p><p>Section 44B. At or before the filing of such petition,

<page id="GA1957.2.P325" no="GA1957.2.2323" />

the same shall be presented to the Judge of the Superior Court of Habersham County, who shall thereupon pass an order calling upon all persons owning or interested in the real estate abutting on said street, or on the designated part thereof, to show cause, at a time and place to be in said order named, why the prayer of the petition should not be granted and the ordinance and assessments declared valid and the liens be fixed as legal and binding, which time shall not be less than 30 nor more than 60 days later, and either in term time or vacation, and either in open court or at chambers. It shall thereupon be the duty of the clerk to publish once a week for four weeks, in the official newspaper of Habersham County, a statement of the case and a copy of said order.<sidenote>Same.</sidenote></p><p><blockquote><p>Section 44C. At the time and place named, or at such other time and place as the hearing may be adjourned to, any person interested shall be heard to show cause in writing, which writing shall be filed with the clerk, why the prayer should not be granted. The court shall hear all questions of law or fact, and all competent evidence may be offered as in other cases; and the court shall thereupon pass an appropriate order finding and adjudging that said ordinance is lawful and valid and said liens legal and binding, or otherwise, as the law and facts may warrant.<sidenote>Same.</sidenote></p></blockquote></p><p><blockquote><p>Section 44D. The commission or any person appearing and who may be dissatisfied with said judgment, may within 10 days file a bill of exceptions and carry the matter up to the Supreme Court or the Court of Appeals, as the case may be, for review as in cases of interlocutory injunction.<sidenote>Same.</sidenote></p></blockquote></p><p><blockquote><p>Section 44E. If the final judgment of the Superior Court shall be in favor of the validity of the ordinance and of the liens claimed, the same shall forever be conclusive, and said matters so determined shall never be thereafter drawn in question in any court.<sidenote>Same.</sidenote></p><p>Section 44F.

In any case in which such bonds have been heretofore issued by the City of Cornelia under the authority of an Act approved August 20, 1927 (Ga. L. 1927, p. 981), it shall be lawful to validate the same and fix the assessments by final judgment of the Superior Court under like proceedings and with like effect: Provided, however, that before the City of Cornelia shall institute such proceedings in such cases, the holder or holders of such bonds of any part thereof shall give to the city good and sufficient bond and security to indemnify and hold harmless the city against any court costs or other expenses incident to such validation proceedings, the sufficiency of such bond and the security to be approved by the chief executive officer of the city.<sidenote>Same.</sidenote></p></blockquote></p><p>Section 2.

To illustrate: if the applicant for a pension during the five consecutive years in which he drew his highest monthly salary or wage drew an average monthly salary or wage of $300.00 per month, he would be entitled to an allowance of a pension or retirement pay in the sum of $150.00 per month.

Any contributing member may, by written designation filed with the treasurer, specify any person, whether related to him or not, to receive from the county treasurer any refund of such member's contribution which may become repayable in the event of such member's death, and if such written designation remains on file with the treasurer at time of death, such refund shall be paid in accordance therewith. If no written designation currently remains at the time of the death of a member, such contribution shall then be refunded to the estate of such deceased member.</p></blockquote></p><p>Section 4.

However, for a teacher now employed by the board of education to receive credit for years of service for teaching outside of Fulton County any time prior to the passing of this Act, such teacher shall pay into the pension fund the amount of contributions that he would have paid into the present pension fund maintained by the board of education, based upon his initial salary paid by said board of education, plus 3% interest compounded annually from the date of employment, if for such years he had been teaching in the Fulton County system. Credit for service other than in Fulton County shall be limited to ten years, for which the teacher or employee claiming credit shall contribute the same amount (viz., the same percentage based on the same salary) as such teacher or employee would have contributed had he or she been a teacher or employee of the school system of Fulton County during the same period.
