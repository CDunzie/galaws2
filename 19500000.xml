of this Act, the court shall make a preliminary inquiry to determine whether the interests of the public or of the child require that further action be taken. Thereupon the court may make such information adjustment as is practical without a petition, or may authorize a petition to be filed by any person. The petition and all subsequent court documents shall be entitled In the Juvenile Court of the..... District. In the interest of a child under seventeen years of age.

Prior to the hearing of a case of any child, the judge may cause an investigation of all the facts pertaining to the issue to be made. Such investigation shall consist of an examination of the parentage and surroundings of the child, his age, habits and history, and shall include also any inquiry into the home conditions, habits and character of his parents or guardian. In such cases the court shall also, if practicable, cause the child to be examined as to his mentality by a competent and experienced psychologist who shall make a report of his findings. Prior to the hearing in the case of any child, if such child attends school, there shall be obtained from the school which he attends, a report concerning him. The school officials shall furnish such report upon the request of the court or its probation officer. The court shall, when it is considered necessary, cause a complete physical examination to be made of the child by a competent physician. <sidenote>Investigation.</sidenote></p>

If the person so summoned shall be other than a parent or guardian of the child, then the parent or guardian or both shall be notified of the pendency of the case and of the time and place appointed, by personal service before the hearing, except as hereinafter provided. Summons may be issued requiring the appearance of any other person whose presence, in the opinion of the judge, is necessary. If it appears that the child is in such condition or surroundings that his welfare requires that his custody be immediately assumed by the court, the judge may order, by endorsement upon the summons, that the officer serving the same shall at once take the child into custody. <sidenote>Summons.</sidenote> <sidenote>Notice.</sidenote> <sidenote>Custody of child.</sidenote></p><p>Section XIV. Service of summons. Service of summons shall be made personally by the delivery of an attested copy thereof to the person summoned; Provided, that if the judge is satisfied that it is impracticable to serve personally such summons or the notice provided for in the preceding section, he may order service by registered mail addressed to the last known address, or by publication thereof, or both. It shall be sufficient to confer jurisdiction if service is effected at least forty-eight hours before the time fixed in the summons for the return thereof. Service of summons, process or notice required by this Act may be made by any suitable person under the direction of the court, and upon request of the court shall be made by any peace officer. <sidenote>Service.</sidenote></p><p>Section XV.

<p>In case the summons cannot be served, or the parties served fail to obey the same, or in any case when it shall be made to appear to the judge that the service will be ineffectual, or that the welfare of the child requires that he shall be brought forthwith into the custody of the court, a warrant or capias may be issued for the parent, guardian or the child. <sidenote>Warrant.</sidenote></p><p>Section XVI. Apprehension and release of children; detention. Any child found violating any law or ordinance, or whose surroundings are such as to endanger his welfare, may be taken into custody by a peace officer or court officer. Such taking into custody shall not be termed an arrest. The jurisdiction of the court shall attach from the time of such taking into custody. When a child is so taken into custody, such officer shall notify the parent, guardian or custodian of the child as soon as possible. Whenever possible, unless otherwise ordered by the court, such child may be released to the custody of his parents or other responsible adult upon the written promise, signed by such person, to bring the child to the court at a stated time or at such time as the court may direct. Such written promise, accompanied by a written report by the officer, shall be submitted to the court as soon as possible. If such person shall fail to produce the child as agreed or upon notice from the court, a summons or a warrant may be issued for the apprehension of such person or of the child. If the child is not released as hereinabove provided, such child shall be taken without unnecessary delay to the court or to the place of detention designated by the court, and as soon as possible thereafter the fact of such detention shall be reported to the court, accompanied by a written report by the officer taking into custody stating (1) facts of the offense, and (2) reasons why the child is not released to the parents. Pending further disposition of the case the court may release such child to the custody of the parent or other person or may detain the child in such place as the court shall designate, subject to further order, but no child shall be held in detention longer than two days unless a petition is filed and an order for such detention is signed by the judge. <sidenote>Apprehension and release of children.</sidenote> <sidenote>Detention.</sidenote></p><p>No child shall be transported in any police vehicle which also contains adults under arrest.

Detention accommodations. Provision shall be made for a detention home or homes for the temporary detention of children, to be conducted by the court, or subject to the approval and supervision of the court, by other appropriate public agency; or the court may arrange for the use of private homes for such detention, subject to the supervision of the court or other agency, or may arrange with any institution or agency to receive for temporary care and custody children within the jurisdiction of the court. When a detention home is established as an agency of the court, necessary professional and other employees for such home shall be appointed in the same manner as is provided for the appointment of other employees of the court. The counties comprising a juvenile court district may provide a central detention facility with the expense of such operation being divided on a pro rata basis according to the population of the counties served. All expenses incurred in providing detention facilities for children coming within the provisions of this Act shall be paid out of county funds, subject to the provisions as set forth in Section 7 (d). <sidenote>Detention accommodations.</sidenote></p>

Upon filing the petition, the court may forthwith, or after first causing an investigation to be made by a probation officer or other person, cause a summons to be issued, signed by the judge, requiring the child to appear before the court, and the parents or the guardian, or the person having the custody, control or supervision of the child, or the person with whom the child may be, to appear with the child, at a place and time stated in the summons, to show cause why the child should not be dealt with according to the provisions of this law. <sidenote>Summons.</sidenote></p><p>Section 4.

It shall be sufficient to confer jurisdiction if service is effected at any time before the time fixed in the summons for the return thereof, but the court, if requested, shall not proceed with the hearing earlier than the third day after the date of the service. Proof of service shall be made substantially as in other cases in the City Court of Polk County.

In such event such person or persons shall be liable to pay to such custodial agency or institution and in such manner as the court may direct the money so adjudged to be payable by him or them.

The conduct of Mr. Fuller, the conductor, and of some others in the hazardous pursuit, while the spies were in possession of the train, deserves the highest commendation and entitles them to consideration of the General Assembly. I therefore, recommend the appointment of a committee of the two houses to inquire into the facts and report upon them, and that such medals or other public acknowledgment be awarded to the parties whose conduct was most meritorious, as will do justice to their services and stimulate others to like deeds of daring when necessary for the public security.
