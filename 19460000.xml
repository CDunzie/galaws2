<p>Be it enacted by the General Assembly of Georgia and it is hereby enacted by authority of the same.</p><p>Section 1. <i>Definitions</i>. As used in this Act, unless the context otherwise requires:</p><p>(1) Airport means any publicly-owned area of land or water designed and set aside for the landing and taking off of aircraft and utilized or to be utilized in the interest of the public for such purposes. <sidenote>Definitions</sidenote></p><p>(2) Airport hazard means any overhead power line which interferes with radio communication between a publicly-owned aircraft approaching or leaving same, or any structure or tree which obstructs the aerial approaches of such an airport is or otherwise hazardous to its use for landing or taking off.</p><p>(3) Political subdivision means any county or municipality of this State.</p><p>(4) Person means any individual, firm, co-partnership, corporation, company, association, joint stock association or body politic, and includes any trustee, receiver, assignee, or other similar representative thereof.</p><p>(5) Structure means any object constructed or installed by man, including, but without limitation, buildings, towers, smoke-stacks, and overhead transmission lines.</p><p>(6) Tree means any object of natural growth.</p><p>Section 2. <i>Airport Hazards Not in Public Interest</i>. It is hereby found and declared that an airport hazard endangers the lives and property of users of the airport and of occupants of land in its vicinity, and also, if of the obstruction type, in effect reduces the size of the area available for the landing, taking-off and maneuvering of aircraft, thus tending to destroy or impair the utility of the airport and the public investment therein, and is therefore not in the interest of the public health, public safety, or general welfare. <sidenote>Airport Hazards</sidenote></p><p>Section 3. <i>Adoption of Airport Zoning Regulations</i></p><p>(1) Every political subdivision may adopt, administer, and enforce, under the police power and in the manner and upon the conditions hereinafter prescribed, airport

<page id="GA1946.1.P123" no="GA1946.1.123" />

zoning regulations for any airport within its jurisdiction, which regulations shall divide the area surrounding the airport into zones, and, within such zones, specify the land uses permitted, and regulate and restrict the height to which structures and trees may be erected or allowed to grow. In adopting or revising any such zoning regulations, the political subdivision shall consider, among other things, the character of the flying operations expected to be conducted at the airport, the nature of the terrain, the height of existing structures and trees above the level of the airport, the possibility of lowering or removing existing obstructions, and the views of the agency of the Federal government charged with the fostering of civil aeronautics, as to the aerial approaches necessary to safe flying operations at the airport. <sidenote>Adoption of Regulations</sidenote></p><p>(2) In the event that a political subdivision has adopted, or hereafter adopts, a general zoning ordinance regulating, among other things, the height of buildings, any airport zoning regulations adopted for the same area or portion thereof under this Act, may be incorporated in and made a part of such general zoning regulations, and be administered and enforced in connection therewith, but such general zoning regulations shall not limit the effectiveness or scope of the regulations adopted under this Act. <sidenote>Matters Incorporated</sidenote></p><p>(3) Any two or more political subdivisions may agree, by ordinance duly adopted, to create a joint board and delegate to said board the powers herein conferred to promulgate, administer and enforce airport zoning regulations to protect the aerial approaches of any airport located within the corporate limits of any one or more of said political subdivisions. Such joint boards shall have as members two representatives appointed by the chief executive officer of each political subdivision participating in the creation of said board and a chairman elected by a majority of the members so appointed. <sidenote>Agreement by Subdivisions</sidenote></p><p>(4) The jurisdiction of each political subdivision is hereby extended to the promulgation, administering and enforcement of airport zoning regulations to protect the approaches of any airport which is owned by said political

subdivision but located wholly or partially outside the corporation limits of said political subdivision. In case of conflict with any airport zoning or other regulations promulgated by any other political subdivision, the regulations adopted pursuant to this subsection shall prevail. <sidenote>Jurisdiction</sidenote></p><p>(5) All airport zoning regulations adopted under this Act shall be reasonable, and none shall require the removal, lowering, or other change or alteration of any structure or tree not conforming to the regulations when adopted or amended, or otherwise interfere with the continuance of any non-conforming use, except as provided in Section 4 (1). <sidenote>Reasonable</sidenote></p><p>Section 4. <i>Permits and Variances</i>. Where advisable to facilitate the enforcement of zoning regulations adopted pursuant to this Act, a system may be established by any political subdivision for the granting of permits to establish or construct new structures and other uses and to replace existing structures and other uses or make substantial changes therein or substantial repairs thereof. In any event, before any non-conforming structure or tree may be replaced, substantially altered or repaired, rebuilt, allowed to grow higher, or replanted, a permit must be secured from the administrative agency authorized to administer and enforce the regulations, authorizing such replacement, change or repair. No such permit shall be granted that would allow the structure or tree in question to be made higher or become a greater hazard to air navigation that it was when the applicable regulation was adopted; and whenever the administrative agency determines that a non-conforming structure or tree has been abandoned or more than 80 percent torn down, destroyed, deteriorated, or decayed; (a) no permit shall be granted that would allow said structure or tree to exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from the zoning regulations; and (b) whether application is made for a permit under this paragraph or not, the said agency may by appropriate action compel the owner of the non-conforming structure or tree, at his own expense, to lower, remove, reconstruct, or equip such object as may be necessary to conform to the regulations or, if the owner of

<page id="GA1946.1.P125" no="GA1946.1.125" />

the non-conforming structure or tree shall neglect or refuse to comply with such order for 10 days after notice thereof, the said agency may proceed to have the object so lowered, removed, reconstructed, or equipped and assess the cost and expense thereof upon the object of the land whereon it is or was located. Unless such an assessment is paid within 90 days from the service of notice thereof on the agent or owner of such object of land, the sum shall bear interest at the rate of 7 percent per annum until paid, and shall be collected in the same manner as are general taxes. Except as indicated, all applications for permits for replacement, change or repair of non-conforming uses shall be granted. <sidenote>Permits</sidenote></p><p>(2) <i>Variances</i>. Any person desiring to erect any structures, or increase the height of any structure, or permit the growth of any tree, or otherwise use his property, in violation of airport zoning regulations adopted under this Act, may apply to the Board of Adjustments, as provided in Section 5 (3), for a variance from the zoning regulations in question. Such variances shall be allowed where a literal application or enforcement of the regulations would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship and the relief granted would not be contrary to the public interest but to substantial justice and be in accordance with the spirit of the regulations and this Act. <sidenote>Variances</sidenote></p><p>(3) <i>Obstruction Marking and Lighting</i>. In granting any permit or variance under this Section, the administrative agency or Board of Adjustments may, if it deems such action advisable to effectuate the purposes of this act and reasonable in the circumstances, so condition such permit or variance as to require the owner of the structure or tree in question to permit the political subdivision at its own expense, to install, operate, and maintain suitable obstruction markers and obstruction lights thereon. <sidenote>Obstructions</sidenote></p><p>Section 5. <i>Procedure</i></p><p>(1) <i>Adoption of Zoning Regulations</i>. No airport zoning regulations shall be adopted, amended, or changed under this Act except by action of the legislative body of the political subdivision in question, of the joint board provided for in Section 3 (3), after a public hearing in relation

At least 15 days' notice of the hearing shall be published in the official gazettes in the political subdivision or subdivisions in which the airport is located. <sidenote>Adoption</sidenote></p><p>(2) <i>Administration of Zoning RegulationsAdministrative Agency</i>. The legislative body of any political subdivision adopting airport zoning regulations under this Act may delegate the duty of administering and enforcing such regulations to any administrative agency under its jurisdiction, or may create a new administrative agency to [Illegible Text] such duty, but such administrative agency shall not be or include any member of the Board of Adjustments. The duties of such administrative agency shall include that of hearing and deciding all permits under Section 4 (1), but such agency shall not have or exercise any of the powers delegated to the Board of Adjustments. <sidenote>Administration Delegated</sidenote></p><p>(3) <i>Administration of Airport Zoning Regulations</i>Board of Adjustments Airport zoning regulations adopted under this Act shall provide for a Board of Adjustments to have and exercise the following powers:</p><p>(a) To hear and decide appeals from any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by the administrative agency in the enforcement of this Act or of any ordinance adopted pursuant thereto;</p><p>(b) To hear and decide special exceptions to the terms of the ordinance upon which such Board may be required to pass under such ordinance; <sidenote>Board of Adjustments</sidenote></p><p>(c) To hear and decide specific variances under Section 4 (2).

All meetings of the Board shall be public. The Board shall keep minutes of its proceedings, showing the vote of each member upon each question, or, if absent or failing to vote, indicating such fact, and shall keep records of its examinations and other official actions, all of which shall immediately be filed in the office of the Board and shall be a public record.</p><p>Appeals to the Board may be taken by any person aggrieved, or by any officer, department, board, or bureau of the political subdivision affected by any decision of the administrative agency.

towers, smoke-stacks, and overhead transmission lines.</p><p>Section 2. <i>Airport Hazards Contrary to Public Interest</i>. It is hereby found that an airport hazard endangers the lives and property of users of the airport and of occupants of land in its vicinity, and also, if of the obstruction type, in effect reduces the size of the area available for the landing, taking-off and maneuvering of aircraft, thus tending to destroy or impair the utility of the airport and the public investment therein. Accordingly, it is hereby declared: (a) that the creation or establishment of an airport hazard is a public nuisance and an injury to the community served by the airport in question; (b) that it is therefore necessary in the interest of the public health, public safety, and general welfare that the creation or establishment of airport hazards be prevented; and (c) that this should be accomplished, to the extent legally possible, by exercise of the police power, without compensation. It is further declared that both the prevention of the creation or establishment of airport hazards and the elimination, removal, alteration, mitigation, or marking and lighting of existing airport hazards are public purposes for which political subdivisions may raise and expend public funds and acquire land or property interests therein. <sidenote>Airport Hazards</sidenote></p><p>Section 3. <i>Power to Adopt Airport Zoning Regulations</i>.

In the event of conflict between the provisions of this Act and the regulations adopted hereunder and any other regulations applicable to the same area, whether the conflict be with respect to height of structures or trees, the use of land, or any other matter, and whether such regulations were adopted by the City of Atlanta or some other authority or political sub-division, the more stringent limitation or requirement shall govern and prevail. <sidenote>Conflict</sidenote></p><p>Section 5. <i>Procedure for Adoption of Zoning Regulations</i>. The procedure required for the adoption of zoning regulations shall be that specified in the general zoning law adopted July 27, 1929 (Georgia Laws, 1929, Page 818, et seq.), and as amended by the several acts amendatory thereof. <sidenote>Procedure of Adoption</sidenote></p><p>Section 6. <i>Airport Zoning Requirements</i>.</p><p>(1) <i>Reasonableness</i>. All airport zoning regulations adopted under this Act shall be reasonable and none shall impose any requirement or restriction which is not reasonably necessary to effectuate the purposes of this Act. In determining what regulations it may adopt, the Planning Commission shall consider, among other things, the character of the flying operation expected to be conducted at the airport, the nature of the terrain within the airport hazard area, the character of the neighborhood, and the uses to which the property to be zoned is put and adoptable. <sidenote>Requirements of Regulations</sidenote></p><p>(2) <i>Non-conforming Uses</i>. No airport zoning regulations adopted under this Act shall require the removal, lowering, or other change or alteration of any structure or tree not conforming to the regulations when adopted or amended, or therwise interfere with the continuance of any non-conforming use, except as provided in Section 7 (3).</p><p>Section 7. <i>Permits and Variances</i>.</p><p>(1) <i>Permits</i>. Any airport zoning regulations adopted under this Act may require that a permit be obtained before any new structure or use may be constructed or established and before any exisiting use or structure may

When said expenses have been ascertained, the governing body shall designate a regular meeting of their body for hearing any and all complaints or objections they may be made respecting assessment of expenses and assessment of cost of said improvements. Notice of said meeting may be given personally or by mail, and shall be given at least five (5) days before said designated meeting date,and to persons against whom assessments are made, and their property. Said notices may be given by the Clerk, or by the Marshal, or by any other officer directed by said body. If mailed, the same may be directed to the last known address of the property owner, and such mailing of notice in the United States mails shall be sufficient. Appearance at said meeting by any owner of property assessed, or owner of any interest therein, personally or by authorized agent or attorney, shall be sufficient to render unnecessary any other or additional notice as to him. The governing body shall at said designated meeting proceed to review and correct said appraisements, apportionments, and assessments, as the facts may require, and to hear and determine all objections. The said body shall by ordinance or resolution fix the assessments in accordance with its actions taken at said meeting, and against the several tracts of land liable therefor.

The governing body shall, however, have authority to direct that those who desire to pay in installments may within thirty (30) days from the passage of said ordinance or resolution, pay the amount of cash installment required, and the remainder in equal annual installments, with interest. The body shall require the remainder to be paid within four (4) years from the date said election is required to be made. Said body may also provide for the taking of notes for deferred installments, which notes may be made payable either to the municipality or to the contractor, as the body may direct. It shall be lawful to provide in said note or in said ordinance or resolution, that if any installment become due and remain unpaid that the whole remaining balance may, at option of the governing body, if no notes taken, or at option of the holder of the notes, if notes taken become due and payable forthwith. The municipality shall have the right and power to assign or otherwise transfer said notes for the purpose of financing said improvements, but it shall not by reason of any assignment or endorsement of such notes assume any financial responsibility for payment of the debt represented thereby, other than to exercise the authority given by law, and by this Act, for the enforcement of said notes and said assessments for the use and benefit of the parties at interest. <sidenote>Apportionment of Expenses</sidenote> <sidenote>Meeting</sidenote> <sidenote>Payment of Assessments</sidenote> <sidenote>Transfer of Notes</sidenote></p><p>Section 7.

the same salary or wages that the number of whole years of service by such disabled employee bears to twenty-five (25) years. To illustrate, the amount of a disability pension based on an average monthly salary or wage of $175.00 after fifteen (15) years of service to the city would be 15-25ths of one-half () of $175.00 or the sum of $52.50 per month. The amount of a disability pension based on an average monthly salary or wage of $225.00 would after nineteen and one-half (19) years of service by 19-25ths of one-half () of $225.00 per month or the sum of $85.50 per month.

If a question should arise at any time as to the continuance of total disability and the eligibility for that reason of the pensioner to continue to receive a pension, the Pension Board shall be authorized from time to time (but not oftener than once each six months) to investigate and inquire into the physical condition of such pensioner and (if it deems advisable) to have such pensioner examined by a physician selected by the Pension Board for that purpose. An issue regarding continuance of disability and eligibility of the pensioner to receive a pension may be framed at the request of any member of the Pension Board or of any member of the Mayor and Council of said city. Thereupon, the Pension Board shall proceed after twenty (20) days' notice to the pensioner to fully investigate and inquire into the question of continuance of disability. <sidenote>Payment Conditioned on Continuance of Disability</sidenote></p><p>Both parties, that is, both the pensioner and the Mayor and Council of said city shall have the right to present

brief description of the character, location and extent of the proposed improvement. Any person interested shall be entitled to be heard at such meeting; if before such meeting a protest against the improvement in writing, signed by the owners of a majority of the lineal feet frontage upon the street, section of street, public place or square proposed to be improved, exclusive of any portion thereof owned by the City, or intersection of streets, and acknowledged, as deeds of real estate are required to be acknowledged, be filed with said Street Committee, they shall not decide in favor of the proposed improvement, nor shall they again consider the same within six months, but the owners of a majority of the frontage of said street, or a similar section of the same, not less than one block in length on said street, may file with the said Street Committee a petition therefor, and in that case the said Street Committee may at any time decide in favor of the improvement as therein requested. 11. If the Street Committee shall determine that such improvement ought to be made, it shall then present to the Mayor and Council a plan and specification of the proposed improvement with a written statement specifying the location, character and extent of such improvement, of what material the same is to be made, and estimated cost thereof, specifying the particulars and estimated items of said cost, with a copy of the resolution of said Street Committee determining that such improvement ought to be made, and an estimated statement of the amount which should be borne by the assessment, and what portion should be paid by the City, said statement to be signed by the Chairman of the Street Committee. 12.

The Street Committee shall then determine the expense of the whole work, including the expense of surveying, advertising legal services, engineering and preparing the assessment list, and cause the average expenses upon each foot of the parcels of land upon both sides of said street, lane or alley, including cross streets, to be ascertained and each and every lot or parcel of real estate to be assessed with its portion of the expenses by multiplying its number of feet front by the average expense per foot. In the event there shall remain a portion or the whole of any block on any street which has not been paved, macadamized or otherwise improved lying between portions of said streets or intersecting with streets which have been paved, macadamized or otherwise improved, the Street Committee, subject to the approval of the Mayor and Council, shall have the power to enter into a contract for paving, macadamizing or otherwise improving that portion of said street without the consent of the abutting property owners if in their judgment they deem such action to be to the best interest of the City; the expense connected therewith to be assessed in the same manner as is provided for other paving, macadamizing or otherwise improving under this Act. 16.

property on any street to the sewer, gas or water mains or pipes connecting them therewith; whenever the residents or owners of said property fail to comply with these requirements, same may be done by the said Street Committee, and such expense shall be assessed against the real property thus improved and connected in the same manner as is required when voluntary connections are made. 17. When work of any local improvement has been completed, the Street Committee shall direct the cost and expense thereof to be assessed by the City Enginer, and it shall be the duty of the said City Engineer immediately to assess the cost and expense,including surveying legal expense, advertising, inspection and assessment of such local improvement, upon the property lying within the district of assessments as heretofore provided, separately assessing and stating the amount assessed for paving, sewer or side-walk respectively, and also stating the amount to be paid by the City, separately stating the amount for paving, sewer, sidewalks or crosswalks. 18. He shall make an assessment roll and set the amount of the cost assessed for each of the said improvements opposite the name of the person, firm, corporation, association and property assessed, which property shall be described by number of lot or otherwise, so that it may be located and identified. When completed said assessment roll shall be deposited in the office of the City Clerk who shall give public notice of the completion of such improvement and of the assessment in a newspaper published in Meriwether County, Georgia, in which legal advertisements appear, for one week, and shall send written notice by mail to each person so assessed, addressed to his last known residence, that such assessment roll has been prepared and will remain at said office for ten days from the date of said notice. The Street Committee shall hear and consider any objection to said assessment and shall decide upon the same and shall if need be alter and correct said assessment roll, and when completed sign the same and file it with the Clerk. Within ten days after the assessment roll is completed, signed and filed any party thinking himself aggrieved may file with the

The Street Committee shall thereupon proceed to hear and determine such appeal or appeals of the owner of the property assessed, hear evidence, and affirm or reverse the assessment and for such purpose may subpoena and compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of papers. In case of affirmance the proceedings thereafter to collect the said assessment shall remain the same as if no appeal had been taken, and in case of reversal the Mayor and Council shall appoint three disinterested freeholders of the City who shall proceed in the manner and for such purposes be invested with the same power as the City Engineer to make a new assesment. They shall make their tax roll in the same manner and sign and file same with the City Clerk, and it shall be conclusive on all parties; such freeholders shall receive not more than four dollars per day for their services, to be paid by the City, unless the assessment of the appellants, as determined by such free-holders, shall be no less favorable to them than the assessment appealed from; in such case the cost of the appeal shall be paid by the appellant, and added to their assessment. If no appeal is taken from the first assessment roll filed with the City Clerk, or if an appeal is taken therefrom and such assessment is affirmed, the Mayor and Council shall approve the same and file the assessment with the City Clerk. If an appeal be taken from such first assessment and the same be reversed, the Mayor and Council shall cause the proper order to be attached to the second assessment roll as made by such freeholders and cause same to be delivered to the City Treasurer; thereupon the City Treasurer shall receive the payments for said local improvements for thirty days without fees.

establishing a government for the community of nations, in order to preserve civilization and enable mankind to live in peace and be free, the following principles and objectives are hereby enunicated in <sidenote>Preamble</sidenote></p><div><title>THE DECLARATION OF THE FEDERATION OF THE<br set="CENTER">WORLD<br set="CENTER" /></br></title><p>Man, the source of all political authority, is a manifold political being. He is a citizen of several communities; the city, the state, the nation and the world. To each of these communities he owes inalienable obligations and from each he receives enduring benefits. <sidenote>Man as Political Being</sidenote></p><p>Communities may exist for a time without being incorporated but, under the stress of adversity, they disintegrate unless legally organized. Slowly but purposefully through the centuries, civilization has united the world, integrating its diverse local interests and creating an international community that now embraces every region and every person on the globe. This community has no government, and communities without governments perish. Either this community must succumb to anarchy or submit to the restraints of law and order. <sidenote>Necessity for Gov't.</sidenote></p><p>Governments can only be established through the deliberate efforts of men. Man has struggled from time immemorial to endow the individual with certain fundamental rights whose very existence is now imperiled. Among those rights is man's freedom to worship, speak, write, assemble and vote without arbitrary interference. To safeguard these liberties as a heritage for the human race, governments were instituted among men, with constitutional guarantees against the despotic exercises of political authority, such as are provided by elected parliaments, trial by jury, habeas corpus and due process of law. Man must now either consolidate his historic rights or lose them for generations to come. <sidenote>Rights Enumerated</sidenote></p><p>The ceaseless changes wrought in human society by science, industry and economics, as well as by the spiritual, social and intellectual forces which impregnate all cultures, make political and geographical isolation of nations hereafter impossible. The organic life of the human

<page id="GA1946.1.P698" no="GA1946.1.699" />

race is at last indossolubly unified and can never be severed, but it must be politically ordained and made subject to law. Only a government capable of discharging all the functions of sovereignty in the executive, legislative and judicial spheres can accomplish such a task. Civilization now requires laws, in the place of treaties, as instruments to regulate commerce between peoples. The intricate conditions of modern life have rendered treaties inffectual and obsolete, and made laws essential and inevitable. The age of treaties is dead; the age of laws is here. <sidenote>Isolation Impossible</sidenote></p><p>Governments, limited in their jurisdiction to local geographical areas, can no longer satisfy the needs or fulfill the obligations of the human race. Just as feudalism served its purpose in human history and was superseded by nationalism, so has nationalism reached its apogee in this generation and yielded its hegemony in the body politic to internationalism. The first duty of government is to protect life and property, and when governments cease to perform this function, they capitulate on the fundamental principle of their raison d'etre. Nationalism, moreover, is no longer able to preserve the political independence or the territorial integrity of nations, as recent his-history so tragically confirms. Sovereignty is an idealogical concept without geographical barriers. It is better for the world to be ruled by an international sovereignty of reason, social justice and peace than by diverse national sovereignties organically incapable of preventing their own dissolution by conquest. Mankind must pool its resources of defense if civilization is to endure. <sidenote>Insufficiency of Nationalism</sidenote></p><p>History has revealed but one principle by which free peoples, inhabiting extensive territories, can unite under one government without impairing their local autonomy. That principle is federation, whose virtue preserves the whole without destroying its parts and strengthens its parts without jeopardizing the whole. Federation vitalizes all nations by endowing them with security and freedom to develop their respective cultures without menace of foreign domination. It regards as sacrosanct man's personality, his rights as an individual and as a citizen and his role as a partner with all other men in the common

<page id="GA1946.1.P699" no="GA1946.1.700" />

enterprise of building civilization for the benefit of mankind. It suppresses the crime of war by reducing to the ultimate minimum the possibility of its occurrence. It renders unnecessary the further paralyzing expenditure of wealth for belligerent activity, and cancels through the ages the mortgages of war against the fortunes and services of men. It releases the full energies, intelligence and assets of society for creative, ameliorative and redemptive work on behalf of humanity. It recognizes man's morning vision of his destiny as an authentic potentiality. It apprehends the entire human race as one family, human beings everywhere as brothers and all nations as component parts of an indivisible community. <sidenote>Principle of Federation</sidenote></p><p>There is no alternative to the federation of all nations except endless war. No substitute for The Federation of the World can organize the international community on the basis of freedom and permanent peace. Even if continental, regional or ideological federations were attempted, the governments of these federations, in an effort to make impregnable their separate defenses, would be obliged to maintain stupendously competitive armies and navies, thereby condemning humanity indefinitely to exhaustive taxation, compulsory military service and ultimate carnage, which history reveals to be not only criminally futile but positively avoidable through judicious foresight in federating all nations. <sidenote>War as Only Alternative</sidenote></p><p>It being Our Profound and Irrevocable Conviction:</p><p>That man should be forever free and that his historic rights as an individual and as a citizen should be protected by all the safeguards sanctioned by political wisdom and experience.</p><p>That governments are essential to the existence of commnuities and that the absence of government is anarchy.</p><p>That there exists an international community, encompassing the entire world, which has no government and which is destined, either to be ruthlessly dominated and exploited by totalitarianism or to be federated by democacy upon the principle of freedom for all nations and individuals. <sidenote>Convictions</sidenote></p><p>That all human beings are citizens of this world community,

<page id="GA1946.1.P700" no="GA1946.1.701" />

which requires laws and not treaties for its government.</p><p>That World Federation is the keystone in the arch of civilization, humanity's charter of liberty for all peoples and the signet authenticating at last the union of the nations in freedom and peace.</p><p>That there are supreme moments in history when nations are summoned, as trustees of civilization, to defend the heritage of the ages and to create institutions essential for human progress. In the Providence of God, such a crisis is this hour, compelling in duty and unprecedented in responsibilitya fateful moment when men meet destiny for the fulfillment of historic tasts.</p><p>Now Therefore, Be It Resolved By Senate, The House Of Representatives Concurring:</p><p>Section 1. That the General Assembly of Georgia does hereby solemnly declare that all peoples of the earth should now be united in a World Federation, and to that end it hereby requests the Senators and Members of the House of Representatives in Congress from the State of Georgia to support and vote for a Resolution in the Congress of the United States, approving the principle of World Federation and requesting the President of the United States to initiate the procedure necessary to formulate a Constitution for the Federation of the World, which shall be submitted to each nation for its ratification. <sidenote>Principle of World Federation Approved</sidenote></p><p>Section 2.
