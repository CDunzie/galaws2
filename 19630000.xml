This made only a broad classification possible.</p><p>General Acts and Resolutions were grouped in one volume beginning at page 1 and running through page 873. The proposed amendments to the Constitution were grouped together beginning at page 661 of Volume One and are followed by a complete index beginning at page 707. This volume is bound separately.</p><p>Local and special Acts and Resolutions were grouped in one volume beginning on page 2001.</p><p>There are no intervening pages between 873 and 2000.</p><p>The index, which is published in full in each volume, covers material included in both volumes. It is in two parts: a broad tabular index which attempts to supply some of the advantages which might have been gained from a more detailed classification, which speed of publication made impossible. This is followed by a regular alphabetical index.</p></note></notediv><body><part><title>ACTS AND RESOLUTIONS<br set="CENTER">OF THE<br set="CENTER"><b>GENERAL ASSEMBLY</b><br set="CENTER">OF THE<br set="CENTER"><b>STATE OF GEORGIA</b><br set="CENTER"><b>1963</b><br set="CENTER" /></br></br></br></br></br></title><law id="L1963V2N001" initial.page="2003" type="INFERRED"><shorttitle>FITZGERALD AND BEN HILL COUNTY DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY.</shorttitle><lawnbr>No. 9</lawnbr><origin>(House Bill No. 72).</origin><fulltitle>An Act to create the Fitzgerald and Ben Hill County Development Authority; to provide the appointment of members of said Authority; to provide for the purpose, duties, control, organization and powers of said Authority; to provide for the duties and powers of the City of Fitzgerald and County of Ben Hill with respect to said Authority; to provide for issuing revenue- anticipation bonds and for the validation of such bonds; to provide for the exemptions applicable to said Authority and to evidences of indebtedness issued by said Authority; to repeal conflicting laws; and for other purposes.</fulltitle><p>Be it enacted by the General Assembly of Georgia:</p><p>Section 1.

If any person desires to contest any election held hereunder, said contest shall be had under the general laws of the State governing municipal contests. In the event that a candidate fails to receive a majority of the votes, there shall be a `run-off' election, between the two candidates receiving the highest number of votes, within 20 days after the results are declared by the mayor, as specified in this section, after giving a 10-day notice of said `run-off' election by advertising the same one time in a newspaper having a general circulation in the City of Lyons, and posting of notices of the same in two public places.</p></blockquote></p><p>Section 2.
