Said petition shall allege that the ordinance is authorized by law, and that it will create a lien on all real property abutting on such street or part of a street, for the payment by the owner of each lot or parcel of land so abutting, of the pro rata share of expense assessed to each said lot or parcel of land, as well as on any street or other railroad therein, if any such there be, and shall pray for a judgment by the court declaring such ordinance valid, legal, and binding, and that the liens be set up as alleged. It shall not be necessary in such petition to allege the names of the owners of the abutting property or railroads to be affected, but shall be sufficient to describe the street or portion thereof to be improved, and to indicate, as hereinbefore provided, that the property on said street is to be charged with the expense.

It shall thereupon be the duty of the clerk to publish once a week for four weeks, in the official organ of the county, a statement of the case and a copy of said order. At the time and place named, or at such other time and place as the hearing may be adjourned to, any person interested shall be heard to show cause in writing, which writing shall be filed with the clerk, why the prayer should not be granted. The court shall hear all questions of law or fact, and all competent evidence may be offered as in other cases; and the court shall thereupon pass an appropriate order finding and adjudging that said ordinance is lawful and valid and said liens legal and binding, or otherwise, as the law and facts may warrant. The municipality or any person appearing, and who may be dissatisfied with said judgment, may within ten days file a bill of exceptions and carry the matter up to the Supreme Court or the Court of Appeals, as the case may be, for review as in cases of interlocutory injunction. If the final judgement of the superior court shall be in favor of the validity of the ordinance and of the liens claimed, the same shall forever be conclusive, and said matters so determined shall never be thereafter drawn in question in any court.

If any property which has been returned for taxation to said city shall be sold for taxes owing said city and shall not be redeemed from such tax sale within the time allowed by law for such redemption, or if any property shall be sold under any other execution issued by said municipal corporation, before any such sale shall become effective to pass the title to such property the commission shall, acting by its secretary, give written notice to the person against whom the execution issued, describing the property, advising him that the property has been sold and that the time of redemption has passed, and further advising that the taxpayer or other defendant in execution may appear before the commission on a day named (which must not be less than fifteen nor more than thirty days from the date of such notice), and submit evidence showing

<page id="GA1927.1.P992" no="GA1927.1.998" />

that an excessive levy was made when said property was levied on, or that the requirements of the law were not compiled with otherwise, and that in default of such appearance, the commission will proceed to determine these questions for itself. This notice must be mailed to the defendant at his last known post-office address. If such person shall appear and shall submit evidence, showing to the satisfaction of the commission that the levy was excessive, or that there was some error in default in the procedure, or if the commission shall, after consideration and without any appearance by the person notified, decide that such levy was excessive or that error was committed in the procedure, then the commission shall direct the levying officer to dismiss the levy already made, and to make a new levy only on so much of said property as shall be reasonably sufficient to pay the amount of the execution and all cost, or to correct the errors committed in making such levy or sale, or both, which order shall be obeyed by the levying officers and all other officers and employees of said city. If, however, the commission shall decide against the objections raised, or shall, if no objections are raised, decide that the levy is not excessive and that no mistakes or errors occurred in the procedure, then such decision in any case shall be final and there shall be no appeal therefrom, and the purchaser at such sale shall acquire a good title. If the property levied on is of such character that it cannot be fairly and practically subdivided and a part only levied on, then the objection to question of an excessive levy shall not be considered, nor shall any such objection or question be considered when the property is properly sold as unreturned property. <sidenote>Tax sales.</sidenote> <sidenote>Title to unredeemed property; notice and hearing to taxpayer.</sidenote> <sidenote>Determination as to legality of tax sale.</sidenote></p><p>Sec. 27.
