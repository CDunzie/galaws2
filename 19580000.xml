The certificates and other obligations of the Authority shall not be, (and shall so state on the face thereof) a debt of the City of Savannah, the County of Chatham, or the State of Georgia.

Such subdivision or subdivisions shall be made a party or parties to the action, and it shall be incumbent on such subdivision or subdivisions to defend against an adjudication of the validity of such contract or be forever bound. Notice of such proceedings shall be included in the notice of validation hearing required to be issued and published by the Clerk of the Superior Court in which such validation proceeding is pending. Any citizen resident in any subdivision which is a party to such contract may intervene in the validation proceedings at or before the time set for the validation hearing by order of the Superior Court and assert any ground of objection to the validity and binding effect of such contract on his own behalf and on behalf of the subdivision and all citizens, residents and property owners thereof.

He shall then announce in the same manner the vote on each proposition or question. Before leaving the room and before closing and locking the registering compartment of the voting machine or machines, the election managers shall make and sign a written certificate showing the results of such election. The transmission and delivery of said certificate by the election managers of each district and of all other papers of the election for the purpose of consolidation, and the consolidation, the certifying and returns thereof, shall all be in complicance with the laws pertaining to municipal elections in the City of Port Wentworth. The written certificate so made, after having been properly certified and signed by the election managers, shall be distinctly and clearly read by one of them in the hearing of all persons present, and ample opportunity shall be given to compare the results so certified with the registering counters of voting machine

<p><blockquote><p>Section 14. The police or mayor's court for the trial of offenders against the laws and ordinances of the City of Lavonia shall be known as the recorder's court, which court is hereby created; the mayor and council are authorized and empowered to elect a recorder to hold said court, fix his qualifications, term of office, and compensation. In the event there is a vacancy in the office of mayor the authority and power given hereinabove shall be vested in the council. Such election shall be made within thirty days after the approval of this Act, and the mayor shall continue to serve until the recorder is elected and qualified. The recorder's court shall begin immediately upon the election and qualification of the recorder. Said recorder so elected shall take such oath as may be prescribed by the mayor and council. Any vacancy in the office of city recorder shall be filled by the mayor and council. Such recorder, and in his absence the mayor, and in the absence of the recorder and the mayor, then the mayor pro tem., and in the absence of all three, any one or more members of the council may hold said court, and may exercise all the powers conferred by law upon the recorder, and may punish for any violation of a city law or ordinance by a fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100), imprisonment in the city jail, or imprisonment in the county jail by permission of the county authorities not exceeding sixty days or work on the street work crew, or other public work under the supervision of the chief of police or the superintendent of the street department, not exceeding sixty days, any one or more, or all of these at the discretion of the trial court. When sitting as a court for the trial of offenders the said court shall have power to punish for contempt by fine not exceeding twenty-five ($25) dollars, imprisonment or work in the manner already prescribed in this section for not exceeding ten (10) days, one or both, at the discretion of the trial court.<sidenote>Recorder's court.</sidenote></p><p>There may be an appeal in any case from the recorder's court to the mayor and council, which appeal must be in writing and entered within two days after the judgment complained of is pronounced; and provided, further, that the defendant gives bond, with security, to abide the final judgment of the case, said bond and security to be approved by the arresting officer or chief of police. The said mayor and council shall as early thereafter as is practicable, hear and determine said case so appealed, and shall investigate the case as fully as if the same had never been tried; that is, de novo. They shall have the power, if they find the defendant guilty, to decrease the fine or sentence imposed by the recorder's court, or to increase it at their discretion; and the judgment of the mayor and council may be reviewed by certiorari to the Superior Court of Franklin County, as is provided for in sections 19-203 to 19-216, both inclusive, Code of Georgia of 1933, and any Act amendatory thereof.</p><p>The clerk of the City of Lavonia shall be eligible to be elected as recorder but neither the mayor nor any member of the council shall be eligible to be elected as recorder.</p><p>The recorder of said city shall be authorized to issue warrants for offenses committed within the corporate limits of said city against any law or ordinance of said city or this State, and when the offense is against the State the recorder may hear evidence and commit to jail or take bond for appearance before the State court having jurisdiction of the offense, as a justice of the peace could do. If the offense charged in the warrant be one against the laws or ordinances of the city, the arresting officer shall carry the case before the recorder's court and none other, and the same there be disposed of as other cases of arrest not made under warrant. All warrants issued by the recorder, or those acting in his stead, shall be directed to the `chief of police of Lavonia, any policeman or marshall thereof, and to all and singular the sheriffs, deputy sheriffs and constable of this State', and any one of said officers shall have the same authority to execute said warrant as the sheriffs of this State have to execute criminal warrants.</p><p>The recorder, or those holding the recorder's court in his stead, shall have the power and authority to subpoena witnesses to attend the recorder's court under the same rules and regulations that regulate and govern the superior courts of this State, to compel their attendance, and to punish any witness, who has been subpoenaed and fails to attend, under the provisions for contempt already provided for in this charter.</p><p>Any police officer of the City of Lavonia shall have authority to release any person arrested for a violation of any law or ordinance of said city, or law over which the recorder may have jurisdiction, upon such person giving bond, with security, payable to the City of Lavonia in an amount and surety to be approved by the policeman or as directed by the city recorder, conditioned for the appearance of such person before the recorder's court at the time and place specified in said bond and from time to time until he or she shall have been tried for the offense for which charged. If any person so released under appearance bond shall fail to appear for trial at the time named therein, such bond shall be forfeited; and a rule nisi shall be issued requiring him or the surety upon such bond to show cause before said court, at a time not less than ten days from the date of such rule, why such bond shall not be absolutely forfeited. Copies of such rule shall be served upon such person or persons to whom it shall be directed at least five days before the return day thereof, provided service may be made personally or by mailing a written notice to such person or persons at their last known address. At the time such rule is made returnable and no sufficient cause be shown, the forfeiture of said bond shall be final and absolute, and execution shall issue for the full amount thereof, and all costs, in the same amounts as are applicable in such cases in the superior courts, against the principal and sureties thereon or such of them as shall have been served.
