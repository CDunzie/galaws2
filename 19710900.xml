Officers Subject to Recall.</b> Any person holding an elective office of Columbus, Georgia whether by election, succession, or appointment to fill a vacancy, shall be subject to removal from office at a recall election in the manner provided in this Chapter.</p><p><b>Section 6-301. Recall Procedure.</b> (1) A recall of an incumbent of an elective office shall be initiated upon petition signed by registered voters. In the case of an elective office to which a candidate is elected from Columbus, Georgia, at large, the petition shall contain signatures of at least fifteen percent (15%) of the electors qualified to vote in the preceding regular election, but signatures from any one district in excess of one-third of the total number required of a petition shall not be counted. In the case of an elective office to which a candidate is elected solely from a council district of Columbus, Georgia, the petition shall contain signatures of registered electors in the district equal in number to at least fifteen per cent (15%) of the electors qualified to vote in the preceding regular election. Every recall petition shall name the officer against whom it is directed.</p><p>(2) Each elector signing a recall petition shall add to his signature his residence, stating his council district and the date of his signing. Signatures on a recall petition may be on separate sheets but each sheet shall have appended to it the affidavit of some person, not necessarily a signer of the petition, that to the best of the affiant's knowledge and belief the persons whose signatures appear on the sheets are registered electors of Columbus, Georgia, or of the district, as the case may be, that they signed with full knowledge of the contents of the petition, and that their residences are correctly given.</p><p>(3) A recall petition shall be tendered for filing to the Ordinary of Columbus, Georgia. The Ordinary shall examine it to see whether it contains a sufficient number of

<page id="GA1971.3.P166" no="GA1971.3.2072" />

apparently genuine signatures. The Ordinary may question the genuineness of any signature or signatures appearing on the recall petition, and if he shall find that any such signature or signatures are not genuine, he shall disregard them in determining whether the petition contains a sufficient number of signatures. He shall also disregard any signature dated more than sixty days before the date the petition was tendered for filing and shall count only one signature of each elector who has signed the petition. The Ordinary shall eliminate any sheet of the petition which is not accompanied by the required affidavit. The invalidity of any sheet of the petition shall not affect the validity of the petition if a sufficient number of signatures remains after eliminating such an invalid sheet. The Ordinary shall complete his examination of the petition within twenty (20) days and shall thereupon file the petition with the Clerk of Council if valid or reject it if invalid.</p><p>(4) As soon as the Ordinary has accepted a recall petition for filing, he shall notify the incumbent named in the petition that the petition has been filed. Upon receipt of such notice, the incumbent may resign from his office and thereupon the recall proceedings shall terminate.</p><p>(5) If the incumbent against whom a recall petition is directed does not resign from his office within the (10) days after notice of the filing of such petition shall have been given to him, the Ordinary shall arrange a recall election. If a regular or special election is to be held not less than thirty (30) days nor more than ninety (90) days after the ten (10) days have expired, the recall question shall be placed before the electors at such an election. Otherwise, a special recall election shall be fixed for a date not earlier than thirty (30) days nor later than sixty (60) days after the ten (10) days have expired. The incumbent against whom a recall petition is directed may resign at any time prior to the recall election and thereupon the election shall not be held.</p><p>(6) The following question shall be presented to each elector in a recall election: Shall (name of Officer) be recalled and removed from the office of (name of office)?

The above question shall appear as to every officer whose recall is to be voted upon and provision shall be made for the elector to vote Yes or No on the question.</p><p>(7) If a majority of the registered electors who vote on the question at a recall election shall vote Yes, the incumbent shall be deemed recalled and removed from office, but if a majority of the registered electors shall vote No, he shall remain in office.</p><p><b>Section 6-302. Limitations.</b> No recall petition shall be filed against any incumbent of an elective office within the first year or the last six months of the term of his office or within six months after an unsuccessful recall election against him; but an officer who has been re-elected for a successive term shall be subject to recall also during the first year of such term.</p></div><div><title><b>Chapter 4</b><br set="CENTER"><b>Initiative and Referendum</b><br set="CENTER" /></br></title><p><b>Section 6-400.

All petitions circulated with respect to any proposed ordinance shall be uniform in character, shall contain the proposed ordinance in full, and shall have printed or written thereon the names and addresses of at least five qualified voters who shall be officially regarded as filing the petition and shall constitute a committee of the petitioners for the purpose hereinafter named. Each signer of a petition shall sign his name in ink or indelible pencil and shall place on the petition opposite his name the date of his signature and his place of residence by street and number. The signatures of any such petition need not all be appended to one paper, but to each paper there shall be attached an affidavit by the circulator thereof, stating the number of signers to

If the Council rejects the proposed ordinance, or passes it in a different form from that set forth in the petition, or fails to act finally upon it within the time stated, then, if within five days thereafter the committee of the petitioners files with the Clerk written demand so do do, the Clerk shall at once upon the expiration of said five days cause three printed or typewritten copies of such petition, without the signatures, to be made. He shall cause said three copies of such petition to be placed on file in his office, and provide facilities for their signing the same, and shall immediately cause notice of the placing of such copies of such petition to be published in some newspaper of general circulation in Columbus, Georgia. Such copies shall remain on file in the office of the Clerk for a period of twenty days, during which time any of them may be signed by a qualified voter of the consolidated government in person, but not by agent or attorney. Each signer of any such copy shall sign his name in ink or indelible pencil and shall place thereafter his residence by street and number. If during said time qualified voters equal to or exceeding twenty-five per cent of the qualified voters in the consolidated government as shown by the official registration list filed for the regular election of Councilmen last held shall sign such copies of said petition, the Clerk shall forthwith certify such fact to the Council.</p>

<p>(4) If an election is to be held not more than three months nor less than thirty days after the aforesaid certification by the Clerk, such proposed ordinance shall be submitted to a vote of the qualified voters at such election. If no election is to be held within the time aforesaid, the Council shall provide for submitting the proposed ordinance to the qualified voters at a special election to be held not later than sixty days nor earlier than thirty days after the publication of such notice, if the petition for such ordinances and the petition for such election so demand, and if the signers of the said copies of said petition amount in the aggregate to at least thirty per cent of the registered voters of the consolidated government; otherwise the same shall be submitted at the next regular or special election. At least ten days before any such election the Clerk shall cause such proposed ordinance to be published.</p><p>(5) The ballots used when voting upon any such proposed ordinance shall state the title of the ordinance to be voted on and below it the two propositions, For the Ordinance and Against the Ordinance, and those voting against the ordinance shall draw a mark through the words For the Ordinance. If a majority of the qualified voters voting on any such proposed ordinance shall vote in favor thereof, it shall thereupon become an ordinance of the consolidated government.</p><p><b>Section 6-401. Approval of Ordinance Form; Drafting.</b> Before any ordinance so proposed shall be submitted to the Council, it shall first be approved as to its form and legal validity by the City Attorney, whose duty it shall be to draft such proposed ordinance in the proper legal language, and to render such other service to persons desiring to propose such ordinances as shall be necessary to make the same proper for consideration of the Council.</p><p><b>Section 6-402. Effect; Manner of Repealing.</b> No ordinance adopted by an electoral vote as hereinbefore provided, can be repealed or amended except by an electoral vote. But an ordinance to repeal or amend any such ordinances may, by resolution of the Council, be submitted to an electoral

vote at any regular election, or at any special election called for some other purpose, provided notice of the intention so to do be published by the Council not more than sixty days not less than thirty days prior to such election. If an amendment is proposed such notice shall contain the proposed amendment in full. Such submission shall be in the same manner, and the vote shall have the same effect as in cases of ordinances submitted to an election by popular petition.</p><p><b>Section 6-403. Repeal by Referendum; Petition; Contents; Filing.</b> (1) If, at any time within thirty days after an ordinance passed by the Council becomes law, an unsigned petition requesting that such ordinance be repealed or amended as stated in the petition, be filed with the Clerk, and said petition after the filing of the same and within said thirty days, as therein the office of said Clerk signed by qualified voters amounting to or exceeding twenty-five per cent of the qualified voters as shown by the official registration list filed for the regular election of Councilmen last held, the Clerk shall thereupon certify said fact to the Council, and the ordinance shall no longer be operative until the steps indicated herein have been taken. Such petition shall have stated therein the names and addresses of at least five qualified voters as a committee to represent the petitioners. Referendum petitions need not contain the text of the ordinance or ordinances the repeal of which is sought, but shall contain the proposed amendment, if an amendment is demanded, and shall be subject in all other respects to the requirements for petitions submitting proposed ordinances to the Council. Ballots used in referendum elections shall conform in all respects to those provided for in section 6-400 (5) herein.</p><p>(2) At the next meeting of the council after said certification by the Clerk, the council shall proceed to reconsider the ordinance. If within thirty days after the date of such certification by the Clerk, the ordinance be not repealed or amended as requested, the Council shall provide for submitting the proposed repeal or amendment to a vote of the qualified voters, provided a majority of the committee named in the petition to represent the petitioners shall, by writing filed with the Clerk within twenty days after the

expiration of said thirty days, so require. In so doing the Council shall be governed by the provisions of section 6-400 (4) herein respecting the time of submission and the manner of voting on ordinances proposed to the Council by petition, excepting that the Council may call, and fix the time for a special election for such purposes if in its judgment the public interests will be prejudiced by delay. If, when submitted to a vote of the qualified voters, such repeal or amendment be approved by a majority of those voting thereon, it shall thereupon go into effect as an ordinance of the consolidated government; but if any such amendment is clearly separable from the remainer of the ordinance and does not materially affect the other provisions of such ordinance, all sections of the ordinance except that sought to be amended and those dependent thereon shall be in effect as though no referendum of any portion of the ordinance had been contemplated; or if any such amendment or repeal of the ordinance is not approved by a majority of those voting therein, then the ordinance passed by the Council shall at once take effect.</p><p>(3) Ordinances submitted to the Council by initiative petition and passed by the Council without change or passed in an amended form and not required to be submitted to a vote of the qualified voters by the committee of the petitioners, shall be subject to the referendum in the same manner as other ordinances. If the provisions of two or more ordinances adopted or approved at the same election conflict, the ordinance receiving the highest affirmative vote shall prevail.</p><p><b>Section 6-404. Expenditure Measures; Action Before Election.</b> In case a petition be filed requiring that a measure passed by the Council providing for an expenditure of money, a bond issue, or a public improvement be submitted to a vote of the qualified voters, all steps preliminary to such actual expenditures, actual issue of bonds, or actual execution of a contract for such improvement, may be taken prior to the election.</p></div>
