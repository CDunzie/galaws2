If it should prove impossible to locate any of the persons so certified or should it become known to the director that any persons not willing to accept the position, the appointing authority may request that additional names be certified until three persons eligible and available for appointment have been certified, if there be as many as three on the register. The appointing authority shall then appoint one of the persons so certified to the position, except that, in the event that he has less than three persons from which to make his selection, he may choose from the remaining certified names or may elect to make a temporary appointment of some other person qualified by the civil service rules. In the event that there does not exist any eligible register which the director deems

<page id="GA1956.2.P468" no="GA1956.2.2468" />

to be appropriate for the class on which the position is established, he shall proceed to prepare such an eligible register as soon as possible, after the receipt of the request of the appointing authority that eligibles be certified.

All regular <b>appointments</b> to the classified service covered by this Act shall be for a <b>probationary</b> period of one year. If during this probationary period the conduct or capacity of the probationer has not been satisfactory to the appointing authority, the probationer and the director shall be notified in writing that he will not receive permanent appointment, otherwise retention in the service longer than for the probationary period of any employee shall constitute permanent appointment.</p><p>Section 9. <b>Temporary and provisional employment.</b> Whenever it is impossible to certify eligible persons for appointment to a vacancy in the classified service, the appointing authority may nominate a person to the director. If such nominee is found by the director to have had experience and training which appears to qualify him for the position, he may be temporarily appointed to such vacancy, but only until an appropriate eligible register can be established and an appointment made therefrom, provided that, the director with the approval of the board may approve a provisional appointment to fill a technical or professional appointment to fill a technical or professional position which requires specialized knowledge or training and which cannot be filled from the eligible register. In no event shall a temporary appointment be continued for more than six months. Successive temporary appointments of the same person shall not be made; not more than one temporary appointment shall be made to any position within any twelve months period.</p><p>Section 10. <b>Examinations.</b> Each eligible register shall consist of a list of all the persons who have shown by competitive examinations that they possess the qualifications

<page id="GA1956.2.P469" no="GA1956.2.2469" />

The examinations must take into consideration elements of character, education, aptitude, experience, knowledge, skills, personality, physical fitness, and other pertinent matters and may be oral or written. Such examinations shall be competitive, free and open to all persons, citizens of Chatham County, who may be lawfully appointed to any position in the class for which they are held, with such limitations as to age, health habits, characters and other qualifications as may be considered desirable by the director and specified in the public announcement of the examination. Notice of the time, place and general scope of every test, shall be given by the board by advertising twice for one week preceding the examination in a newspaper of general circulation published in Chatham County. Competitive examinations to determine the qualifications of persons who seek employment as ordinary unskilled laborers shall not be required. The board shall designate a class to be known as the labor class which shall include all ordinary unskilled laborers. All other matters pertaining to ordinary unskilled laborers shall be governed by this Act.</p><p>Section 11. <b>Rating and eligibility.</b> Examination papers shall be rated on the scale of one hundred, and the subject therein shall be given <b>such</b> relative weights as may be prescribed. In rating these papers no person shall willfully or corruptly make any false representation concerning the same or concerning the persons examined, or willfully or corruptly furnish to any one special or secret information for the purpose of improving or injuring the chances of appointment or promotion of any person examined. All competitors rated seventy or more shall be eligible for appointment, and their name shall be placed on the proper register according to their attained rating. The term of eligibility shall be one year, commencing with the date on which the name of the eligible is entered on the register. This term may be extended in the discretion of the director for all those on any register when

<page id="GA1956.2.P470" no="GA1956.2.2470" />

conditions of good administration render it expedient to hold a new examination.</p><p>Section 12. <b>Promotion.</b> Promotion of employees covered by this article shall be made only according to merit and fitness and must be ascertained by competitive examinations, regardless of the number of applicants seeking promotion. Such examinations shall be conducted by the director, who shall certify the three highest examinees to the appointing authority who shall appoint one of the examinees. Any classified employee promoted to any other classified position shall serve a probationary period of twelve months during which time he may be demoted to his former position without right of appeal to the civil service board.</p><p>Section 13. <b>Re-employment.</b> (1) Whenever any employee in the classified service, who has been performing his duties in a satisfactory manner as shown by the records of the department or other agency in which he has been employed, is laid off because of lack of work or lack of funds, or has been on authorized leave of absence and is ready to report for duty when a position is open, or has resigned in good standing and with the consent of the director and the head of the department under whose jurisdiction he was employed, and has withdrawn his resignation without being restored to his position, the director shall cause the name of such employee to be placed on the re-employment list for the appropriate class for re-employment within three years thereafter when vacancies in the class occur. The order in which names shall be placed on the re-employment list for any class shall be in the order according to dates of application for re-employment. No person shall be reinstated or have his name restored to a re-employment list unless such resignation is withdrawn within three years after it has been presented and accepted.</p><p>(2) When a vacancy exists which the appointing authority has decided to fill by re-employment, the appointing authority shall submit to the director in such form

<page id="GA1956.2.P471" no="GA1956.2.2471" />

as may be prescribed by the board a request that the director certify to him the names of persons eligible for re-employment in the class in which the vacant position is established. The director shall immediately certify to the appointing authority the names of persons on appropriate registers.</p><p>Section 14. <b>Transfers.</b> An appointing authority may, at any time, transfer any classified employee under his jurisdiction from one position to another in the same classification provided, that the director has authorized the transfer of the employee from one department to another and has received approval of both appointing authorities concerned. In every such case the appointing authority shall give written notice of this action to the director. No transfer shall be made to a competitive position in the classified service above the lowest grade, unless the appointing authority shall certify to the director, who shall make proper investigation in connection therewith, that the position involved cannot be adequately filled by promotion from the personnel in the respective department.</p><p>Section 15. <b>Demotion.</b> An appointing authority may in accordance with the rules and regulations established by the board demote for cause a classified employee under his jurisdiction from a position in one class to a position in a lower class, but only after the employee involved and the director have been notified in writing of such contemplated action. Any employee holding permanent employment in the classified service who is demoted by any appointing authority may appeal his or her demotion to the board for consideration and review. The board may in its discretion restore any employee who has been demoted.</p><p>Section 16. <b>Suspension.</b> Any appointing authority may suspend a subordinate in the classified service for cause and may recommend to the board that he be dismissed from the service or recommend suspension, <b>demotion</b> or transferral. Such appointing authority shall, within

<page id="GA1956.2.P472" no="GA1956.2.2472" />

twenty-four hours of such suspension, file with the board a copy of the written notice furnished the employee so suspended, setting forth in detail the reason for such action and his recommendations in the premises. The dismissed employee, if holding permanent employment in the classified service, shall have an opportunity to answer the charges in writing within ten days and to file with the board affidavits in support of such answer. All papers filed in the case shall be subject to inspection by the persons affected. It shall then be the duty of the board, upon an investigation and a hearing thereon, to either approve or disapprove the suspension by the appointing authority and where recommendations are made, to either approve or disapprove such recommendations with authority where the cause is shown to suspend the employee for any period of time it may designate; or reinstate the employee to his former status and in their discretion with authority to direct payment of salary during such period of suspension preceding the trial; or to transfer, demote or dismiss said employee. Provided, however, that the board within thirty days from any action removing, demoting, suspending or accepting the resignation of any officer or employee may on its own motion or on the motion of any part, re-open the case and vacate, modify or revise its former order so as to lessen but not increase the penalty imposed, but after the end of such thirty days, the board shall not have any authority to re-open such case for any cause. Where an appointing authority has adopted or hereafter adopts rule for the compulsory retirement of all of its employees upon their reaching an age provided by such appointing authority, the provisions of this article shall be subject to any such rule of such appointing authority.</p><p>Section 17. <b>Lay-off and leave of absence without pay.</b> An appointing authority may lay off a classified employee whenever he deems it requisite due to unusual conditions or shortage or stoppage of work or funds. In every case of this kind the appointing authority shall, before the effective date thereof, give written notice of his contemplated action to the employee involved and

the director. Any person who has been appointed to a position in the classified service, or who shall have attained a civil service status, under the provisions of this Act, other than a temporary or provisional appointee, and who has been laid off for the reasons stated in this section of the Act, shall have his name placed on an appropriate re-employment register. Leave of absence for a period not to exceed ten consecutive months in any twelve months period may be granted to any employee without pay upon request of the employee when approved by the appointing authority and the director notified in writing.</p><p>Section 18. <b>Removal.</b> Any appointing authority may dismiss a subordinate in the classified service for cause, upon filing with the board copy of written notice furnished the employee to be removed, setting forth in detail the reasons for such action, before the effective date of such removal. The dismissed employee shall have an opportunity to answer the charges in writing within ten days, and to file with the board affidavits in support of such answer. All papers filed in the case shall be subject to inspection by the persons affected. Such action of the appointing authority shall be final, except the board may reinstate an officer or employee so removed in case it appears after proper hearing that the removal was made for personal, political or religious reasons and not justified. If the board finds the action of the <b>appointing</b> authority was unjustified, the employee shall be reinstated without loss of pay for the period suspended. The board may after proper investigation of the circumstances surrounding the dismissal and the fairness thereof, approve the transfer or re-employment of the employee involved either to the same position, if approved by the appointing authority, or to a lower position as the board may direct. Provided, however, the board within thirty days from any action removing, demoting, suspending or accepting the resignation of any officer or employee may on its own motion, or on the motion of any party, re-open the case and vacate, modify or revise its former order so as to lessen, but not increase, the penalty imposed, but

<page id="GA1956.2.P474" no="GA1956.2.2474" />

after the end of such thirty days the board shall not have any authority to re-open such case for any cause. Where an appointing authority has adopted or hereafter adopts a rule for compulsory retirement of all of its employees upon their reaching an age provided by such appointing authority, the provisions of this Act shall be subject to any such rule of such appointing authority.</p><p>Section 19. <b>Appeals.</b> Whenever the director refuses to examine an applicant or after examination to certify, an eligible as provided in this act, then said director if requested by the person so rejected, shall give to him a full and explicit statement of the exact cause for such refusal to examine or certify, as the case may be. The person so rejected may ask for a review of the case by the board, which shall be granted, and said board by a majority vote shall have power to render a final decision in writing to the person asking for the review. Such decision of the board shall be binding on all concerned.</p><p>Section 20. <b>Political activity and recommendations.</b> In applying the provisions of this Act or in doing any of the things hereby provided, no person whosoever shall give any consideration to political or religious affiliations. No person holding a position in the classified service shall directly or indirectly solicit or receive in any manner or be concerned with soliciting or receiving any assistance or subscriptions or contributions for any political purpose, or participate in any form of political activity whatsoever, other than to express privately his views as a citizen and to cast his vote in any election.
