If the majority of those voting in such election shall vote in favor of recalling any Commissioner, his office shall become vacant from the time that the results of said election are announced to the Commission, and the vacant office shall be filled in accordance with the provisions of this Act regulating the election of a Commissioner every year, except that the election shall be held as soon as the same can be legally done, under said provisions, and without waiting for the coming of the dates provided for. Any person so recalled may become a candidate in the election to elect his successor. Any person elected to succeed the recalled Commissioner shall only hold office for the remainder of the unexpired term of the recalled Commissioner.

In the event there shall remain a portion or the whole of any block on any street, which has not been paved, macadamized or telfordized lying between portions of said street or intersecting with streets which have been paved, macadamized or telfordized, the Street Committee, subject to the approval of the Mayor and Council, shall have the power to enter into a contract for paving, macadamizing or telfordizing that portion of said street so unimproved without the consent of the abutting property owners if in their judgment they deem such action to be to the best interest of the city; the expense connected therewith to be assessed in the same manner as is provided for other paving, macadamizing or telfordizing under this Act.

When work of any local improvement has been completed, the Street Committee shall direct the cost and expense thereof to be assessed by the city engineer, and it shall be the duty of the said city engineer to immediately assess the cost and expense, including surveying, advertising, inspection and assessment of such local improvement, upon the property lying within the district of assessment as heretofore provided, separately assessing and stating the amount assessed for paving, sewer or sidewalks respectively, and also stating the amount to be paid by the city separately, stating the amount for paving, sewer, sidewalks or crossings. He shall make an assessment roll and set the amount of the tax assessed for each of said improvements opposite the name of the person, corporation, association and property assessed, which property shall be briefly described by number of lot or otherwise, so that it may be located and identified. When completed said assessment role shall be deposited in the office of the city clerk and the city clerk shall give public notice in one of the city newspapers for one week of the completion thereof, and send written notice by mail to each person so assessed, addressed to his last known residence, that such assessment role has been prepared and will remain at said office for ten days from the date of said notice, during which time any person interested may examine such roll. On the day and hour specified in said notice, the Street Committee shall hear and consider any objection to said assessment and shall decide upon the same and shall if need be alter and correct said assessment roll, and when completed sign the name and file it with the clerk.

In case of affirmance the proceedings thereafter to collect the said assessment shall remain the same as if no appeal had been taken; in case of reversal the Mayor and Council shall appoint three disinterested freeholders of the city who shall proceed in like manner and for such purpose be invested with the same power as the city engineer to make a new assessment. They shall make their tax roll in the same manner and and sign the same and file it with the city clerk and it shall be conclusive upon all parties; such freeholders shall receive four dollars per day for their services, to be paid by the city unless the assessment of the appellants, as determined by said freeholders, shall be no less favorable to them than the assessment appealed from, in which case the fees of such freeholders shall be paid by the appellants and added to the amount of their tax respectively by said freeholders in proportion to the amount thereof. If no appeal is taken from the first assessment roll filed with the city clerk, or if an appeal be taken therefrom and such assessment be affirmed, the Mayor and Council shall cause the proper warrant to be attached thereto and to be delivered to the city clerk. If an appeal be taken from such first assessment and the same be reversed the Mayor and the Council shall cause the proper warrant to be attached to the second assessment roll by such freeholders and to be delivered to the city treasurer; thereupon the city treasurer shall receive the taxes for said local improvements for thirty days without fees.
