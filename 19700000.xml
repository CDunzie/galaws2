<notediv><title><b>Compiler's Note</b><br set="CENTER" /></title><note><p>To speed publication, the Acts and Resolutions of the 1970 session, with the exception of the proposed amendments to the Constitution, were sent to the printer in the order in which they were released from the Governor's office. This made only a broad classification possible.</p><p>General Acts and Resolutions were grouped in one volume beginning at page 1 and running through page 1336. The proposed amendments to the Constitution were grouped together beginning at page 973 of Volume One and are followed by a complete index beginning with page 1155. This volume is bound separately.</p><p>Local and Special Acts and Resolutions were grouped in one volume beginning on page 2001. Revisions and amendments of municipal charters made pursuant to The Municipal Home Rule Act of 1965 as amended, and filed in the Office of Secretary of State during 1969 are printed in Volume Two beginning on page 3524. Home Rule Actions By Counties filed in the Office of Secretary of State during 1969 are printed in Volume Two beginning on page 3505.</p><p>There are no intervening pages between 1336 and 2000.</p><p>The index, which is published in full in each volume, covers material included in both volumes. It is in two parts: a broad tabular index which attempts to supply some of the advantages which might have been gained from a more detailed classification, which speed of publication made impossible, and this is followed by a regular alphabetical index.</p></note></notediv><body><part><preface><p>LOCAL AND SPECIAL ACTS AND RESOLUTIONS OF THE <b>GENERAL ASSEMBLY</b> OF THE <b>STATE OF GEORGIA 1970</b></p></preface><title><br set="CENTER" /></title><law id="L1970V2N001" initial.page="2003" type="INFERRED"><shorttitle>WALKER COUNTYSALARIES OF EMPLOYEES OF CLERK OF SUPERIOR COURT.</shorttitle><lawnbr>No. 728</lawnbr><origin>(Senate Bill No. 296).</origin><fulltitle>An Act to amend an Act placing the clerk of the superior court of Walker County on a salary basis, approved January 24, 1964 (Ga.

The principal and interest of such revenue bonds shall be payable solely from the special fund herein provided for such payment.

Same; Negotiability; Exemption from Taxation</b>. All revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this Act shall have and are hereby declared to have all the qualities and incidents of negotiable instruments under the negotiable instruments law of the State. Such bonds and the income thereof shall be exempt from all taxation within the State.</p><p><b>Section 14. Same; Sale; Price</b>. The Authority may sell such bonds in such manner and for such price as it may determine to be for the best interest of the Authority, but no such sale shall be made at a price so low as to require the payment of interest on the money received therefor at a greater rate than the interest allowed by the Revenue Bond Law as now provided or may hereafter be provided by amendment thereto, computed with relation to the absolute maturity of the bonds in accordance with standard tables of bond values, excluding, however, from such computation the amount of any premium to be paid on redemption of any bond prior to maturity.</p><p><b>Section 15. Same; Proceeds of Bonds</b>. The proceeds of such bonds shall be used solely for the payment of the cost of the project or projects, and unless otherwise provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in

<page id="GA1970.2.P459" no="GA1970.2.2460" />

the trust indenture, additional bonds may in like manner be issued to provide the amount of such deficit, which unless otherwise provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust indenture, shall be deemed to be of the same issue and shall be entitled to payment from the same fund without preference or priority of the bonds first issued for the same purpose. If the proceeds of the bonds of any issue shall exceed the amount required for the purpose for which such bonds are issued, the surplus shall be paid into the fund hereinafter provided for the payment of principal and interest of such bonds.</p><p><b>Section 16. Same; Interim Receipts and Certificates or Temporary Bonds</b>. Prior to the preparation of definitive bonds, the Authority may, under like restrictions issue interim receipts, interim certificates or temporary bonds, with or without coupons exchangeable for definitive bonds upon the issuance of the latter.</p><p><b>Section 17.

Conditions Precedent to Issuance; Object of Issuance</b>. Such revenue bonds may be issued without any other proceedings or the happening of any other conditions or things than those proceedings, conditions and things which are specified or required by this Act. In the discretion of the Authority, revenue bonds of a single issue may be issued for the purpose of any particular project. Any resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds under the provisions of this Act shall become effective immediately upon its passage and need not be published or posted, and any such resolution may be passed at any regular or special or adjourned meeting of the Authority by a majority of its members.</p><p><b>Section 19. Credit Not Pledged</b>. Revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this Act shall not be deemed to constitute a debt of Newton County or a pledge of the faith and credit of said county, but such bonds shall be payable

<page id="GA1970.2.P460" no="GA1970.2.2461" />

solely from the fund hereinafter provided for and the issuance of such revenue bonds shall not directly, indirectly or contingently obligate said county to levy or to pledge any form of taxation whatever therefor or to make any appropriation for the payment, and all such bonds shall contain recitals on their face covering substantially the foregoing provisions of this Section.</p><p><b>Section 20. Same; Trust Indenture as Security</b>. In the discretion of the Authority, any issue of such revenue bonds may be secured by a trust indenture by and between the Authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or outside of the State. Such trust indenture may pledge or assign fees, tolls, revenues and earnings to be received by the Authority. Either the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or such trust indenture may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the Authority in relation to the acquisition of property, the construction of the project, the maintenance, operation, repair and insurance of the project, and the custody, safeguarding and application of all moneys, and may also provide that any project shall be constructed and paid for under the supervision and approval of consulting engineers or architects employed or designated by the Authority, and satisfactory to the original purchasers of the bonds issued therefor and may also require that the security given by contractors and by any depository of the proceeds of the bonds or revenues or other moneys be satisfactory to such purchasers, and may also contain provisions concerning the conditions, if any, upon which additional revenue bonds may be issued. It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of this State to act as such depository and to furnish such idemnifying bonds or pledge such securities as may be required by the Authority. Such indenture may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee, and may restrict the individual right of action of bondholders as is customary in trust indentures securing bonds and debentures of corporations.

<page id="GA1970.2.P461" no="GA1970.2.2462" />

In addition to the foregoing, such trust indenture may contain such other provisions as the Authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust indenture may be treated as a part of the cost of maintenance, operation and repair of the project affected by such indenture.</p><p><b>Section 21. Same; To Whom Proceeds of Bonds Shall be Paid</b>. The Authority shall, in the resolution provided for the issuance of revenue bonds or in the trust indenture, provide for the payment of the proceeds of the sale of the bonds to any officer or person who, or any agency, bank or trust company which shall act as trustee of such funds and shall hold and apply the same to the purposes hereof, subject to such regulations as this Act and such resolution or trust indenture may provide.</p><p><b>Section 22. Same; Sinking Fund</b>. The revenues, fees, tolls and earnings derived from any particular project or projects, regardless of whether or not such fees, earnings, and revenues were produced by a particular project for which bonds have been issued unless otherwise pledged and allocated, may be pledged and allocated by the Authority to the payment of the principal and interest on revenue bonds of the Authority as the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust instrument may provide, and such funds so pledged from whatever source received, which said pledge may include funds received from one or more or all sources, shall be set aside at regular intervals as may be provided in the resolution or trust indenture, into a sinking fund which said sinking fund shall be pledged to and charged with the payments of (1) the interest upon such revenue bonds as such interest shall fall due, (2) the principal of the bonds as the same shall fall due, (3) the necessary charges of paying agents for paying principal and interest, and (4) any premium upon bonds retired by call or purchase as hereinabove provided. The use and disposition of such sinking fund shall be subject to such regulations as may be provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the revenue bonds or in the trust indenture, but, except as may otherwise be provided

<page id="GA1970.2.P462" no="GA1970.2.2463" />

in such resolution or trust indenture, such sinking fund shall be a fund for the benefit of all revenue bonds without distinction or priority of one over another. Subject to the provisions of the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust indenture surplus monies in the sinking fund may be applied to the purchase or redemption of bonds and any such bonds so purchased or redeemed shall forthwith be cancelled and shall not again be issued.</p><p><b>Section 23. Same; Remedies of Bondholders</b>. Any holder of revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this Act or any of the coupons appertaining thereto, and the trustee under the trust indenture, if any, except to the extent the rights herein given may be restricted by the resolution passed before the issuance of the bonds or by the trust indenture, may, either at law or in equity, by suit, action, mandamus, or other proceedings, protect and enforce any and all rights under the laws of the State of Georgia or granted hereunder or under such resolution or trust indenture, and may enforce and compel performance of all duties required by this Act or by such resolution or trust indenture, to be performed by the Authority, or any officer thereof, including the fixing, charging, and collecting of revenues, fees, tolls, and other charges for the use of the facilities and services furnished.</p><p><b>Section 24. Same; Refunding Bonds</b>.

Same; Venue and Jurisdiction</b>. Any action to protect or enforce any rights under the provisions of this Act or any suit or action against such Authority shall be brought in the Superior Court of Newton County, Georgia,

any any action pertaining to validation of any bonds issued under the provisions of this Act shall likewise be brought in said court which shall have exclusive, original jurisdiction of such actions.</p><p><b>Section 26. Same; Validation</b>. Bonds of the Authority shall be confirmed and validated in accordance with the procedure of the Revenue Certificate Law of 1937, as amended. The petition for validation shall also make party defendant to such action any municipality, county, authority, subdivision, or instrumentality of the State of Georgia which has contracted with the Authority for furnishing or receiving the services and facilities of the water and sewerage system for which bonds are to be issued and sought to be validated and such municipality, county, authority, subdivision or instrumentality shall be required to show cause, if any, why such contract or contracts and the terms and conditions thereof should not be inquired into by the court and the validity of the terms thereof be determined aid the contract or contracts adjudicated as security for the payment of any such bonds of the Authority. The bonds when validated, and the judgment of validation shall be final and conclusive with respect to such bonds, against the Authority issuing the same, and any municipality, county, authority, subdivision or instrumentality contracting with the said Newton County Water and Sewerage Authority.</p><p><b>Section 27. Same; Interests of Bondholders Protected</b>. While any of the bonds issued by the Authority remain outstanding, the powers, duties or existence of said Authority or of its officers, employees or agents shall not be diminished or impaired in any manner that will affect adversely the interests and rights of the holders of such bonds, and no other entity, department, agency or authority will be created which will compete with the Authority to such an extent as to affect adversely the interests and rights of the holders of such bonds, nor will the State itself so compete with the Authority.

<page id="GA1970.2.P835" no="GA1970.2.2836" />

be secured by a trust indenture by and between the Authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without the State. Such trust indenture may pledge or assign fees, tolls, revenues and earnings to be received by the Authority. Either the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or such trust indenture may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the Authority in relation to the acquisition of property, the construction of the project, the maintenance, operation, repair and insuring of the project, and the custody, safeguarding and application of all monies, and may also provide that any project shall be constructed and paid for under the supervision and approval of consulting engineers or architects employed or designated by the Authority, and satisfactory to the original purchasers of the bonds issued therefor, and may also require that the security given by contractors and by any depositary of the proceeds of the bonds or revenues or other moneys be satisfactory to such purchasers, and may also contain provisions concerning the conditions, if any, upon which additional revenue bonds may be issued. It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of this State to act as such depositary and to furnish such indemnifying bonds or pledge such securities as may be required by the Authority. Such indenture may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee, and may restrict the individual right of action of bondholders as is customary in trust indentures securing bonds and debentures of corporations. In addition to the foregoing, such trust indenture may contain such other provisions as the Authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust indenture may be treated as a part of the cost of maintenance, operation and repair of the project affected by such indenture.</p><p><b>Section 15. To whom proceeds of bonds shall be paid</b>.The Authority shall, in the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or in the trust indenture, provide

<page id="GA1970.2.P836" no="GA1970.2.2837" />

for the payment of the proceeds of the sale of the bonds to any officer or person who or any agency, bank or trust company which shall act as trustee of such funds and shall hold and apply the same to the purposes hereof, subject to such regulations as this Act and such resolutions or trust indentures may provide.</p><p><b>Section 16. Sinking Fund</b>.The revenues, fees, tolls and earnings derived from any particular project or projects, regardless of whether or not such fees, earnings, and revenues were produced by a particular project for which bonds have been issued unless otherwise pledged and allocated, may be pledged and allocated by the Authority to the payment of the principal and interest on revenue bonds of the Authority as the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust instrument may provide, and such funds so pledged from whatever source received, which said pledge may include funds received from one or more or all sources, shall be set aside at regular intervals as may be provided in the resolution or trust indenture, into a sinking fund which said sinking fund shall be pledged to and charged with the payment of (1) the interest upon such revenue bonds as such interest shall fall due, (2) the principal of the bonds as the same shall fall due, (3) the necessary charges of paying agents for paying principal and interest and other investment charges, and (4) any premium upon bonds retired by call or purchase as hereinabove provided. The use and disposition of such sinking fund shall be subject to such regulations as may be provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the revenue bonds or in the trust indenture, but, except as may otherwise be provided in such resolution or trust indenture, such sinking fund shall be maintained as a trust account for the benefit of all revenue bonds without distinction or priority of one over another. Subject to the provisions of the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust indenture any surplus monies in the sinking fund may be applied to the purchase or redemption of bonds and any such bonds so purchased or redeemed shall forthwith be cancelled and shall not again be issued.</p><p><b>Section 17. Remedies of bondholders</b>.Any holder of

revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this Act or any of the coupons appertaining thereto, and the trustee under the trust indenture, if any, except to the extent the rights herein given may be restricted by resolution passed before the issuance of the bonds or by the trust indenture, may, either at law or in equity, by suit, action, mandamus, or other proceedings, protect and enforce any and all rights under the laws of the State of Georgia or granted hereunder or under such resolution or trust indenture, and may enforce and compel performance of all duties required by this Act or by such resolution or trust indenture, to be performed by the Authority, or any officer thereof, including the fixing, charging, and collecting of revenues, fees, tolls, and other charges for the use of the facilities and services furnished.</p><p><b>Section 18. Refunding bonds</b>.The Authority is hereby authorized to provide by resolution for the issuance of bonds of the Authority for the purpose of funding or refunding any revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this Act and then outstanding, together with accrued interest thereon and premium, if any. The issuance of such funding or refunding bonds, the maturities and all other details thereof, the rights of the holders thereof, and the duties of the Authority in respect to the same, shall be governed by the foregoing provisions of this Act insofar as the same may be applicable.</p><p><b>Section 19. Validation</b>.Bonds of the Authority shall be confirmed and validated in accordance with the procedure of the Revenue Bond Law, as amended. The petition for validation shall also make party defendant to such action the State of Georgia or any municipality, county, authority, political subdivision or instrumentality of the State of Georgia which has contracted with the Authority for the services and facilities of the project for which bonds are to be issued and sought to be validated and the State or such municipality, county, authority, political subdivision or instrumentality shall be required to show cause, if any exist, why such contract or contracts and the terms and conditions thereof should not be inquired into by the court and the contract

or contracts adjudicated as a part of the basis of the security for the payment of any such bonds of the Authority. The bonds when validated, and the judgment of validation shall be final and conclusive with respect to such bonds and the security for the payment thereof and interest thereon and against the Authority issuing the same, and the State and any municipality, county, authority, political subdivision or instrumentality if a party to the validation proceedings, contracting with the said Gwinnett County Water and Sewerage Authority.</p><p><b>Section 20. Venue and jurisdiction</b>.Any action to protect or enforce any rights under the provisions of this Act or any suit or action against such Authority shall be brought in the Superior Court of Gwinnett County, Georgia, and any action pertaining to the validation of any bonds issued under the provisions of this Act shall likewise be brought in said court which shall have exclusive, original jurisdiction of such actions.</p><p><b>Section 21. Interests of bondholders protected</b>.While any of the bonds issued by the Authority remain outstanding, the powers, duties or existence of said Authority or of its officers, employees or agents shall not be diminished or impaired in any manner that will affect adversely the interests and rights of the holders of such bonds, and no other entity, department, agency or authority will be created which will compete with the Authority to such an extent as to affect adversely the interests and rights of the holders of such bonds, nor will the State itself so compete with the Authority. The provisions of this Act shall be for the benefit of the Authority and the holders of any such bonds, and upon the issuance of bonds under the provisions hereof, shall constitute a contract with the holders of such bonds.</p><p><b>Section 22. Moneys received considered trust funds</b>.All moneys received pursuant to the authority of this Act, whether as proceeds from the sale of revenue bonds, as grants or other contributions, or as revenues, income, fees and earnings, shall be deemed to be trust funds to be held and applied solely as provided in this Act.</p>

Powers declared supplemental and additional</b>.The foregoing sections of this Act shall be deemed to provide an additional and alternative method for the doing of the things authorized thereby and shall be regarded as supplemental and additional to powers conferred by other laws, and shall not be regarded as in derogation of any powers now existing.

Any resolution, providing for the issuance of revenue bonds under the provisions of this Act shall become effective immediately upon its passage and need not be published or posted, and any such resolution may be passed at any regular or special or adjourned meeting of the Authority by a majority of the quorum as in this Act provided.</p><p><b>Section 17.

Same; Trust Indenture as Security</b>In the discretion of the Authority, any issue of such revenue bonds may be secured by a trust indenture by and between the Authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or outside of the State.

It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of this State to act as such depository and to furnish such indemnifying bonds or pledge such securities as may be required by the Authority. Such indenture may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee, and may restrict the individual right of action of bondholders as is customary in trust indentures securing bonds and debentures of corporations. In addition to the foregoing, such trust indenture may contain such other provisions as the Authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust indenture may be treated as a part of the cost of maintenance, operation and repair of the project affected by such indenture.</p><p><b>Section 19.

The principal and interest of such revenue bonds shall be payable solely from a special fund herein provided for. The bonds of each issue shall be dated, shall bear interest at the lowest attainable rate, payable in such medium of payment as to both principal and interest as may be determined by the Authority and may be made redeemable before maturity, at the option of the Authority, as such price or prices and under such tems and conditions as may be fixed by the Authority in the resolution in providing for the issuance of the bonds. <sidenote>Same.</sidenote></p><p>(b) The Authority shall determine the form of the bonds, including any interest coupons to be attached thereto, and shall fix the denomination or the denominations of the bonds and the place or places of payment of principal in interest thereof, which may be at any bank or trust company within or without the State.

Such trust indenture may pledge or sign rents, revenues, and earnings to be received by the Authority. Either the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or the trust indenture itself may contain such provisions for perfecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including convenants setting forth the duties of the Authority in relation to the acquisition of property, the construction of the project, the maintenance, operation, repair, and insurance of the project or projects, and the custody, safeguarding and application of all monies and revenues, and may also provide that any project shall be constructed and paid for under the supervision and approval of consulting engineers or architects employed or designated by the Authority and satisfactory to the original purchasers of the bonds issued

Such indenture may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee and may restrict the individual right of action of bondholders as is customary in trust indentures securing bonds and debentures of corporations. In addition to the foregoing, such trust indenture may contain such other provisions as the Authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders.</p><p>(i) All revenues, rents, and earnings derived from any project or projects and all funds from any source whatsoever received by the Authority may be pledged and allocated by the Authority to the payment of principal and interest on revenue bonds of the Authority as the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or the trust instrument may provide, and such funds so pledged by whatever source received shall be set aside at regular intervals as may be provided in the resolution or trust indenture into a sinking fund which shall be pledged to and charged with the payment of (1) interest upon such revenue bonds as such interest shall fall due, (2) the principal of the bonds as the same shall fall due, (3) the necessary charges of paying agents for paying principal and interest and (4) any premium upon bonds retired by call or purchase as hereinbefore provided. The use and disposition of such sinking fund shall be subject to such regulations as may be provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the revenue bonds or in the trust indenture, but, except as may otherwise be provided in such resolution or trust indenture, such sinking fund shall be affirmed for the benefit of all revenue bonds without distinction or priority of one over the other.</p><p>(j) Any holder of revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this Act, or any of the coupons appertaining thereto, and the trustee under the trust indenture, if any, except to the extent the rights herein given may be restricted by resolution passed before the issuance of the bonds or by the trust indenture, may, either at law or in equity, by suit, action, mandamus, or other proceedings, protest and enforce any and all rights under the laws of the State of Georgia which are granted hereunder or under such resolution or trust indenture, and may enforce and compel performance
