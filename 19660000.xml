<notediv><title><b>Compiler's Note</b><br set="CENTER" /></title><note><p>To speed publication, the Acts and Resolutions of the 1966 session, with the exception of the proposed amendments to the Constitution, were sent to the printer in the order in which they were released from the Governor's office. This made only a broad classification possible.</p><p>General Acts and Resolutions were grouped in one volume beginning at page 1 and running through page 1309. The proposed amendments to the Constitution were grouped together beginning at page 743 of Volume One and are followed by a complete index beginning at page 1109. This volume is bound separately.</p><p>Local and special Acts and Resolutions were grouped in one volume beginning on page 2001. The Municipal Home Rule Act of 1965, as amended, is printed in Volume Two beginning on page 3439 and is followed by revisions and charter amendments made thereunder and filed in the Office of the Secretary of State during 1965.</p><p>There are no intervening pages between 1309 and 2000.</p><p>The index, which is published in full in each volume, covers material included in both volumes. It is in two parts: a broad tabular index which attempts to supply some of the advantages which might have been gained from a more detailed classification, which speed of publication made impossible. This is followed by a regular alphabetical index.</p></note></notediv>

The provision herein shall be retroactive to cover any pensioner or his beneficiary who had service in excess of twelve months for which no pension benefits were received.<sidenote>Same.</sidenote></p></blockquote></p><p>Section 3. By striking the last two sentences in the last paragraph of section 5a, as contained in section 3 of an Act approved March 9, 1945 (Ga. L. 1945, p. 1080, et. seq.), which amended an Act approved March 28, 1935 (Ga. L. 1935, p. 450 et seq.), which amended an Act approved August 24, 1931 (Ga. L. 1931, p. 223 et seq.), all of said Acts being amendments to the Act set forth in the caption to this Act, and enacting in lieu thereof the following two sentences:</p><p><blockquote><p>In determining the number of years of service, fractional parts of years shall be counted. That is to say, the person who has served eighteen (18) years and nine (9) months would be pensioned on a basis of eighteen and seventy-five one-hundredths twenty-fifths (18.75/25ths) of the full pension or for eighteen (18) and three-fourths (3/4ths) years of service.<sidenote>Same.</sidenote></p></blockquote></p><p>so that said section, as amended, shall read as follows:</p><p><blockquote><p>Section 5a. Should any member become totally disabled not in line of duty but not on account of injuries or ill health brought about on account of his own indiscretion so as to make such member unfit for fire duty or service, he shall receive a pension graduated as follows: After 5 years and less than 10 years of service, he shall be entitled to receive as a pension 5/25ths of the pension that he would have received if he had served 25 years; after 10 years of service, he would be entitled to receive as a pension 10/25ths of the full pension that he would have received if he had served 25 years and each year thereafter there shall be a graduated increase based upon the number of

<page id="GA1966.2.P1001" no="GA1966.2.3000" />

years that he serves as bears to his years of service based upon the 25 years. To illustrate, if he becomes totally disabled after 11 years of service, he would be entitled to receive 11/25ths of the full pension that he would be entitled to after 25 years of service and progressively thereafter, so that if he should become disabled after 24 years of service, he would be entitled to receive 24/25ths of the pension he would be entitled to after serving 25 years, but in no event shall he receive more than 25/25ths of the amount of pension he would have received after serving 25 years.</p><p>Upon the death of any member or pensioner not in line of duty his widow, if any, shall be paid during the rest of her life or until she remarries three-fourths of the pension that the member or pensioner would have been entitled to if he himself had applied for a pension at the time of his death and graduated according to the length of service of the deceased husband before his retirement on account of disability or before his death and the said graduated scale shall be on the same ratio and computed in the same manner as set out above in this section as to a member becoming totally disabled after 5 years of service and applying for a disability pension except that the widow shall be entitled to only three-fourths of the amount of pension that her husband would have been entitled to. To illustrate, after 5 years of service and less than 10 years of service, she would be entitled to three-fourths of 5/25ths of the full pension that her husband would have been entitled to if he had served 25 years and the illustrations as applied to the first part of this Act, as to service after 10 years, is applicable here except that the widow would only be entitled to recover three-fourths of the amount that her deceased husband would have been entitled to. Provided, however, that no such widow shall receive any sum hereunder, unless she was the lawful wife of said pensioner prior to the time he became disabled. If said pensioner or member die without leaving a widow, or if pensioner's widow was not the lawful wife of pensioner prior to his disability, the pensioner's minor child or children except children adopted subsequent to said pensioner's retirement from active service shall be paid the same gross sums according

<page id="GA1966.2.P1002" no="GA1966.2.3001" />

to the same graduated scale as set out above for the widow until such child or children reach the age of 16 years. In determining the number of years of service, fractional parts of years shall be counted. That is to say, the person who has served eighteen (18) years and nine (9) months would be pensioned on a basis of eighteen and seventy-five one-hundredths twenty-fifths (18.75/25ths) of the full pension or for eighteen (18) and three-fourths (3/4ths) years of service.</p></blockquote></p><p>Section 4. By adding the following to section 1(c) of an Act approved February 7, 1955 (Ga. L. 1955, p. 2051 et seq.), which said Act was amended by an Act approved April 5, 1961 (Ga.

Before making such a request, such local governing body shall submit to the qualified voters thereof in a referendum, to be prescribed by local legislative Act, the question of whether it should participate further in the Authority or not.

You point out that no separate vote is shown for the various political subdivisions within Cobb County and ask if you are authorized to proclaim passage of the Amendment.</p><p>Your attention is directed to the pertinent portion of Article XIII, Section I, Chapter 2-81 of the Constitution of Georgia of 1945, codified as Section 2-8101 of the Code of Georgia Annotated, dealing with Amendments to the Constitution, not general in nature but affecting only a particular local area of the State, which provides:</p><p><blockquote><p>A proposed amendment which is not general shall only be submitted to the people of the political subdivision or subdivisions directly affected. The vote of the electors in each political subdivision affected shall be counted separately in determining whether such proposed amendment is ratified, and it must be ratified by a majority of the electors qualified to vote for members of the General Assembly voting thereon in each such political subdivision before it shall become a part of this Constitution.</p></blockquote></p><p>The word subdivision as used in the above Section has been defined to mean a political subdivision in Towns v. Suttles, 208 Ga. 838 at p. 840.</p><p>Since Constitutional Amendment No. 40 affects both the incorporated and the unincorporated areas of Cobb County, it would appear that you are without authority to proclaim passage of the Amendment until evidence is submitted to you that the Amendment has been ratified by majority vote of the electors voting in each of the incorporated areas of Cobb County, as well as by a majority of electors voting in the unincorporated area of said county.</p><p>With kind personal regards and wishing you a happy and fruitful New Year, I am</p><p>Sincerely,</p><imgtable><img src="I19662016" /></imgtable><pre>EUGENE COOK,<br set="RIGHT">The Attorney General<br set="RIGHT">EC:an<br /></br></br></pre></div>
