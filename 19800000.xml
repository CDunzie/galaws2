Same; interest of bondholders protected.</b> While any of the bonds issued by the Authority remain outstanding, the powers, duties of existence of said Authority or of its officers, employees, or agents, shall not be diminished or impaired in any manner that will affect adversely the interests and rights of the holders of such bonds, and no other entity, department, agency, or authority, will be created which will compete with the Authority to such an extent as to affect adversely the rights and interests of the holders of such bonds, nor will the State itself so compete with the Authority. The provisions of this Act shall be for the benefit of the Authority and the holders of any such bonds, and upon the issuance of bonds under the provisions hereof, shall constitute a contract with the holders of such bonds.</p><p><b>Section 23.

maturity of the bonds in accordance with standard tables of bond values, excluding, however, from such computation the amount of any premium to be paid on redemption of any bond prior to maturity.</p><p><b>Section 15.</b> Same; Proceeds of Bonds. The proceeds of such bonds shall be used solely for the payment of the cost of the project or projects, and unless otherwise provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust indenture, additional bonds may in like manner be issued to provide the amount of such deficit, which unless otherwise provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust indenture, shall be deemed to be of the same issue and shall be entitled to payment from the scme fund without preference or priority of the bonds first issued for the same purpose. If the proceeds of the bonds of any issue shall exceed the amount required for the purpose for which such bonds are issued, the surplus shall be paid into the fund hereinafter provided for the payment of principal and interest of such bonds.</p><p><b>Section 16.</b> Same; Interim Receipts and Certificates or Temporary Bonds.

<page id="GA1980.2.P459" no="GA1980.2.3439" />

<p><b>Section 19.</b> Credit Not Pledged. Revenue Bonds issued under the provisions of this Act shall not be deemed to constitute a debt of Oconee County or a pledge of the faith and credit of said county, but such bonds shall be payable solely from the fund hereinafter provided for and the issuance of such revenue bonds shall not directly, indirectly or contingently obligate said county to levy or to pledge any form of taxation whatever therefor or to make any appropriation for the payment, and all such bonds shall contain recitals on their face covering substantially the foregoing provisions of this Section.</p><p><b>Section 20.</b> Same; Trust Indenture as Security. In the discretion of the Authority, any issue of such revenue bonds may be secured by a trust indenture by and between the Authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or outside of the State. Such trust indenture may pledge or assign fees, tolls, revenues and earnings to be received by the Authority. Either the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or such trust indenture may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the Authority in relation to the acquisition of property, the construction of the project, the maintenance, operation, repair and insurance of the project, and the custody, safeguarding and application of all moneys, and may also provide that any project shall be constructed and paid for under the supervision and approval of consulting engineers or architects employed or designated by the Authority, and satisfactory to the original purchasers of the bonds issued therefor and may also require that the security given by contractors and by any depository of the proceeds of the bonds or revenues or other moneys be satisfactory to such purchasers, and may also contain provisions concerning the conditions, if any, upon which additional revenue bonds may be issued. It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of this State to act as such depository and to furnish such indemnifying bonds or pledge such securities as may be required by the Authority. Such indenture may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee, and may restrict the individual right of action of bondholders as is customary in trust indentures securing bonds and debentures of corporations. In addition to the foregoing, such trust indenture may contain such other provisions as the Authority may deem

<page id="GA1980.2.P460" no="GA1980.2.3440" />

reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust indenture may be treated as a part of the cost of maintenance, operation and repair of the project affected by such indenture.</p><p><b>Section 21.</b> Same; To Whom Proceeds of Bonds Shall be Paid. The Authority shall, in the resolution provided for the issuance of revenue bonds or in the trust indenture, provide for the payment of the proceeds of the sale of the bonds to any officer or person who, or any agency, bank or trust company which shall act as trustee of such funds and shall hold and apply the same to the purposes hereof, subject to such regulations as this Act and such resolution or trust indenture may provide.</p><p><b>Section 22.</b> Same; Sinking Fund. The Revenues, fees, tolls and earnings derived from any particular project or projects, regardless of whether or not such fees, earnings, and revenues were produced by a particular project for which bonds have been issued unless otherwise pledged and allocated, may be pledged and allocated by the Authority to the payment of the principal and interest on revenue bonds of the Authority as the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust instrument may provide, and such funds so pledged from whatever source received, which said pledge may include funds received from one or more or all sources, shall be set aside at regular intervals as may be provided in the resolution or trust indenture, into a sinking fund which said sinking fund shall be pledged to and charged with the payments of (1) the interest upon such revenue bonds as such interest shall fall due, (2) the principal of the bonds as the same shall fall due, (3) the necessary charges of paying agents for paying principal and interest, and (4) any premium upon bonds retired by call or purchase as hereinabove provided. The use and disposition of such sinking fund shall be subject to such regulations as may be provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the revenue bonds or in the trust indenture, but, except as may otherwise be provided in such resolution or trust indenture, such sinking fund shall be a fund for the benefit of all revenue bonds without distinction or priority of one over another. Subject to the provisions of the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust indenture surplus monies in the sinking fund may be applied to the purchase or redemption of bonds and any such bonds so purchased or redeemed shall forthwith be cancelled and shall not again be issued.</p>

<page id="GA1980.2.P461" no="GA1980.2.3441" />

<p><b>Section 23.</b> Same; Remedies of Bondholders. Any holder of revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this Act or any of the coupons appertaining thereto, and the trustee under the trust indenture, if any, except to the extent the rights herein given may be restricted by resolution passed before the issuance of the bonds or by the trust indenture, may, either at law or in equity, by suit, action, mandamus, or other proceedings, protect and enforce any and all rights under the laws of the State of Georgia or granted hereunder or under such resolution or trust indenture, and may enforce and compel performance of all duties required by this Act or by such resolution or trust indenture, to be performed by the Authority, or any officer thereof, including the fixing, charging, and collecting of revenues, fees, tolls, and other charges for the use of the facilities and services furnished.</p><p><b>Section 24.</b> Same; Refunding Bonds.

Either the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or such trust indenture may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the authority in relation to the acquisition of property, the construction of the project, the maintenance, operation, repair, and insurance of the project, and the custody, safeguarding, and application of all moneys; and may also provide that any project shall be constructed and paid for under the supervision and approval of consulting engineers or architects employed or designated by the authority, and satisfactory to the original purchasers of the bonds issued therefor; and may also require that the security given by contractors and by any depositary of the proceeds of the bonds or revenues or other moneys be satisfactory to such purchasers; and may also contain provisions concerning the conditions, if any, upon which additional revenue bonds may be issued. It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of this state to act as such depositary and to furnish such indemnifying bonds or pledge such securities as may be required by the authority. Such indenture may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders as is customary in trust indentures securing bonds and debentures of corporations. In addition to the foregoing, such trust indenture may contain such other provisions as the authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust indenture may be treated as a part of the cost of maintenance, operation, and repair of the project affected by such indenture.</p><p><b>Section 16.</b> Same; to whom proceeds of bonds shall be paid. The authority shall, in the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or in the trust indenture, provide for the payment of the proceeds of the sale of the bonds to any officer or person who, or any agency, bank, or trust company which, shall act as trustee of such funds and shall hold and apply the same to the purposes hereof, subject to such regulations as this Act and such resolution or trust indenture may provide.</p>

<p><b>Section 17.</b> Same; sinking funds. The revenues, fees, tolls, and earnings derived from any particular project or projects, regardless of whether or not such have been issued, unless otherwise pledged and allocated, may be pledged and allocated by the authority to the payment of the principal and interest on revenue bonds of the authority as the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust instrument may provide. Such funds so pledged, from whatever source received, including funds received from one or more or all sources, shall be set aside at regular intervals as may be provided in the resolution or trust indenture into a sinking fund, which said sinking fund shall be pledged to and charged with the payments of (1) the interest upon such revenue bonds as such interest shall fall due, (2) the principal of the bonds as the same shall fall due, (3) the necessary charges of paying agents for paying principal and interest, and (4) any premium upon bonds retired by call or purchase as hereinabove provided. The use and disposition of such sinking funds shall be subject to such regulations as may be provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the revenue bonds or in the trust indenture; but, except as may otherwise be provided in such resolution or trust indenture, such sinking fund shall be a fund for the benefit of all revenue bonds without distinction or priority of one over another. Subject to the provisions of the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust indenture, surplus moneys in the sinking fund may be applied to the purchase or redemption of bonds and any such bonds so purchased or redeemed shall forthwith be canceled and shall not again be issued.</p><p><b>Section 18.</b> Same; remedies of bondholders. Any holder of revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this Act or any of the coupons appertaining thereto, and the trustee under the trust indenture, if any, except to the extent the rights herein given may be restricted by resolution passed before the issuance of the bonds or by the trust indenture, may, either at law or in equity, by suit, action, mandamus, or other proceedings protect and enforce any and all rights under the laws of the State of Georgia, or granted hereunder, or under such resolution or trust indenture, and may enforce and compel performance of all duties required by this Act or by such resolution or trust indenture to be performed by the authority, or any officer thereof, including the fixing, charging, and collecting of revenues, fees, tolls, and other charges for the use of the facilities and services furnished.</p>

<p><b>Section 19.</b> Same; refunding bonds. The authority is hereby authorized to provide by resolution for the issue of revenue refunding bonds of the authority for the purpose of refunding any revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this Act and then outstanding, together with accrued interest thereon. The issuance of such revenue refunding bonds, the maturities and all other details thereof, the rights of the holders thereof, and the duties of the authority in respect to the same shall be governed by the foregoing provisions of this Act insofar as the same may be applicable.</p><p><b>Section 20.</b> Same; venue and jurisdiction. Any action to protect or enforce any rights under the provisions of this Act or any suit or action against such authority shall be brought in the Superior Court of Murray County and any action pertaining to validation of any bonds issued under the provisions of this Act shall likewise be brought in said court which shall have exclusive, original jurisdiction of such actions.</p><p><b>Section 21.</b> Same; validation. Bonds of the authority shall be confirmed and validated in accordance with the procedure of the Revenue Bond Law, as amended. The petition for validation shall also make party defendant to such action any municipality, county, authority, subdivision, or instrumentality of the State of Georgia which has contracted with the authority for services and facilities of the water system for which bonds are to be issued and sought to be validated; and such municipality, county, authority, subdivision, or instrumentality shall be required to show cause, if any, why such contract or contracts and the terms and conditions thereof should not be inquired into by the court and the validity of the terms thereof be determined and the contract or contracts adjudicated as security for the payment of any such bonds of the authority. The bonds when validated and the judgment of validation shall be final and conclusive with respect to such bonds against the authority issuing the same; and any municipality, county, authority, subdivision, or instrumentality contracting with the said Murray County Water and Sewer Authority.</p><p><b>Section 22.</b> Same; interest of bondholders protected. While any of the bonds issued by the authority remain outstanding, the powers, duties, or existence of said authority or of its officers, employees, or agents shall not be diminished or impaired in any manner that will affect adversely the interest and rights of the holders of such bonds;

<page id="GA1980.2.P480" no="GA1980.2.3460" />

and no other entity, department, agency, or authority will be created which will compete with the authority to such an extent as to affect adversely the rights and interests of the holders of such bonds; nor will the state itself so compete with the authority. The provisions of this Act shall be for the benefit of the authority and the holders of any such bonds and, upon the issuance of bonds under the provisions hereof, shall constitute a contract with the holders of such bonds.</p><p><b>Section 23.</b> Moneys received considered trust funds. All moneys received pursuant to the authority of this Act, whether all proceeds from the sale of revenue bonds as grants or other contributions or as revenues, fees, and earnings, shall be deemed to be trust funds to be held and applied solely as provided in this Act.</p><p><b>Section 24.</b> Purpose of the authority. (a) Without limiting the generality of any provision of this Act, the general purpose of the authority is declared to be that of acquiring an adequate source or sources of water supply, treatment of such water, and thereafter the distribution of same to the various townships and citizens in Murray County and environs, including adjoining counties and municipalities located therein, and, further, for the general purpose of gathering and treatment of waste, both individual and industrial; but such general purpose shall not restrict the authority from selling and delivering water directly to consumers in those areas where there do not now exist water distribution systems or furnishing sewer facilities to such consumers and areas where neither any county nor municipality deems it desirable or feasible to furnish water in such locality.</p><p>(b) The authority shall also have the authority, where it deems it feasible, to sell its products and services to consumers, governmental agencies, or governmental instrumentalities of adjoining states, provided the laws of the adjoining states do not prohibit or tax said activity.</p><p>(c) The authority shall not have the authority to construct water lines for the distribution of water directly to consumers within any water district or municipality without first obtaining the express written consent of the appropriate governing bodies of the above referred to water districts or municipalities.</p>

It shall be the duty of the authority to prescribe rules and regulations for the operation of the project or projects constructed under the provisions of this Act, including the basis on which water and sewer service and facilities shall be furnished.</p><p><b>Section 27.</b> Powers declared supplemental and additional.

The total amount of such required contributions shall be increased

<page id="GA1980.2.P713" no="GA1980.2.3694" />

The total amount of such required contribution shall be decreased by the amount previously paid into the pension fund by a regular officer or employee and not withdrawn upon termination of employment plus an amount equal to seven percent (7%) per annum compounded of such amount not withdrawn from the date of termination to the date of filing of the application. As to credit for part-time or temporary service with the city, such previous service credit shall be on the basis of one day for each day worked by such person as a temporary employee or on a part-time basis, except that the required contribution shall be based upon the gross salary of such person at the time of filing of the application for previous service credit. The payment of the contributions of previous service credit for previous employment as a regular, temporary, or part-time employee of the city may be paid upon the filing of the application for such credit or such officer or employee shall have a period of sixty (60) months from the date of filing the application in which to pay such contributions, provided, however, the total amount of such contribution shall bear interest at seven percent (7%) per annum on the unpaid balance.</p><p>The Board of Trustees is authorized to establish rules and regulations for extending the period in which back pension contributions may be paid provided that interest in the amount of seven percent (7%) per annum shall be added to any amounts not paid within the above specified period.

of a Transportation Project to and from and within said District, and the Local Governing Body of Clayton County, subject to the conditions hereinafter provided in this subsection, is hereby authorized to enter into contracts for and on behalf of said District with the Authority for the provision of the aforesaid services and System to and from and within said District. As a condition precedent to the Local Governing Body of Clayton County exercising any power pursuant to this subsection, the Rapid Transit Contract and Assistance Agreement by and between the Authority, the Counties of Fulton and DeKalb, and the City of Atlanta, dated September 1, 1971, as amended, must first be amended to provide that any rapid transit contract between Clayton County on behalf of the entire county and the Authority which requires Clayton County to levy the sales and use tax authorized by this Act throughout its territorial limits shall also provide for the extension of the rapid transit system and project into Clayton County to provide rapid transit services within Clayton County on substantially the same basis that such services are provided or will be provided within Fulton and DeKalb counties, without the necessity of any payment being made by Clayton County other than the proceeds of the sales and use tax levied throughout its territorial limits.</p></blockquote></p><p><b>Section 4.</b> Said Act is further amended by adding immediately after the first sentence of subsection (a) of Section 25, and before the second sentence, the following:</p><p><blockquote><p>Provided, in the event Clayton County acting for and on behalf of the Clayton County-Atlanta Airport Public Transportation District that may be created in accordance with Section 24(l) of this Act and the Authority enter into a rapid transit contract pursuant to Section 24 of this Act, said retail sales and use tax shall be levied only within the geographical area contained within said District.</p></blockquote></p><p><b>Section 5.</b> Said Act is further amended by striking from the next to last sentence of subsection (a) of Section 25, the following:</p><p><blockquote><p>governed by any of the local governments imposing the tax,,</p></blockquote></p><p>and by inserting in lieu thereof the following:</p><p><blockquote><p>in which the tax is imposed,,</p></blockquote></p>

<page id="GA1980.2.P854" no="GA1980.2.3835" />

<p>so that when amended by the immediately preceding Section 4 and this Section 5, Section 25(a) shall read as follows:</p><p><blockquote><p>(a) Authority to Tax. Each of the local governing bodies of those local governments referred to and defined in Section 2 of the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority Act of 1965 (Ga. Laws 1965, p. 2243), as amended, which shall hereafter pursuant to the provisions of said Act enter into a rapid transit contract with the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority that has become final and binding upon its local government by compliance with the provisions of Section 24 of said Act and approval of the voters as therein required, shall be authorized to levy a retail sales and use tax upon the retail purchase, retail sale, rental, storage, use or consumption of tangible personal property, and the services described and set forth in Ga. Laws 1951, p. 360, as amended, on sales, uses and services rendered, in the geographical area governed by such local government. Provided, in the event Clayton County acting for and on behalf of the Clayton County-Atlanta Airport Public Transportation District that may be created in accordance with Section 24(l) of this Act and the Authority enter into a rapid transit contract pursuant to Section 24 of this Act, said retail sales and use tax shall be levied only within the geographical area contained within said District. Provided, however, the tax herein authorized shall not be levied by any local government unless the same is also levied in the geographical areas of Fulton and DeKalb Counties. The tax imposed shall correspond, so far as practicable, except as to rate, with the Georgia Retailers' and Consumers' Sales and Use Tax Act, approved February 20, 1951 (Ga. Laws 1951, p. 360), as amended, and as it may be from time to time amended. Provided, however, that no tax shall be imposed upon the sale of tangible personal property which is ordered by and delivered to the purchaser at a point outside the geographical area in which the tax is imposed, regardless of the point at which title passes, if such delivery is made by the seller's vehicle, U.S. mail, common carrier or by private or contract carrier licensed by the Interstate Commerce Commission or the Georgia Public Service Commission. Provided further that the tax authorized to be levied herein shall apply, any law to the contrary notwithstanding, to the retail sale, rental, storage, use, or consumption of motor fuel as the term `motor fuel' is defined by Code Section 92-1402 or, after January 1, 1980, by Code Section 91A-5002.</p></blockquote></p>

Laws p. 761), as amended, the usury laws of the State of Georgia or any other laws of the State of Georgia shall not apply to bonds, revenue bonds, notes or other obligations of the Authority issued pursuant to this Act.

<page id="GA1980.2.P895" no="GA1980.2.3876" />

<p><blockquote><p>Section 8. For purposes of validation of revenue bonds as provided under the Revenue Bond Law (1937 Ga. Laws p. 761), as amended, the Authority shall be considered to be located in the City of Marietta, Cobb County, Georgia.</p><p>Section 9. The Authority may provide for the replacement of any Bonds issued by it which shall be lost, mutilated or destroyed.</p><p>Section 10. In the discretion of the Authority, any issue of bonds pursuant to this Act may be secured by a trust indenture by and between the Authority and a trustee, which may be any trust company, any bank having the powers of a trust company within or outside the State, any national banking association organized under the laws of the United States, or an individual. Such trust indenture may pledge or assign fees, tolls, revenues, rents, receipts, earnings or other funds to be received by the Authority, including the proceeds derived from the sale from time to time of any surplus property of the Authority, either real or personal. The resolution providing for the issuance of such bonds or the trust indenture may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee and may prescribe the procedure by which bondholders may enforce their rights. Such resolution or trust indenture may also provide that any project shall be constructed and paid for under the supervision and approval of consulting engineers or architects satisfactory to the trustee or to the bondholders, and may also require that the security given by any contractors and by any depository of the proceeds of the bonds or revenues or other monies be satisfactory to such trustee or bondholders, and may also contain provisions concerning the conditions, if any, upon which additional revenue bonds may be issued pari passu with the revenue bonds initially issued pursuant to such resolution or trust indenture. It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of this State or any national banking association organized under the laws of the United States to act as such depository and to furnish such security as may be required by the Authority. All expenses incurred in connection with any such resolution or trust indenture may be treated as operating expenses of the Authority. This Section is illustrative and does not limit the types of instruments which may secure or provide for any issue of bonds or the terms and provisions which any resolution adopted by the Authority or any instrument executed by the Authority may contain. Any resolution adopted by the Authority or any indenture of trust, trust agreement, or other instrument executed by

<page id="GA1980.2.P896" no="GA1980.2.3877" />

the Authority may contain such terms and provisions as the Authority shall approve. Such approval of the Authority shall be conclusively established by the execution of any such resolution, indenture of trust, trust agreement or other instrument by the Chairman or Vice Chairman of the Authority and the attestation of such execution by the Secretary or any Assistant Secretary of the Authority. Nothing in this Section or this Act shall be construed to require, for any issue of revenue bonds, a trustee or a trust indenture, trust agreement or similar instrument.</p><p>Section 11. In addition to and not in limitation of other powers granted in this Act as to the issuance of revenue bonds and security for such bonds, the Authority shall have the power to enter into any financial and contractual arrangements which it deems appropriate with users or owners of projects in order to provide security to bondholders, and for such purposes it may also enter into joint agreements, arrangements or trust indentures with such users or owners and a trustee or trustees under any trust indenture in order that funds may be procured to accomplish the purposes of this Act.</p><p>Section 12. While any of the bonds issued by the Authority remain outstanding, the powers, duties or existence of the Authority or of its officers, employees or agents shall not be diminished or impaired in any manner that will adversely affect the interest and rights of the holders of such bonds.</p><p>Section 13. All bonds of the Authority issued under the provisions of this Act are declared to be issued for an essential public purpose and the said bonds and the income therefrom shall at all times be exempt from taxation within the State.</p><p>Section 14. Any bonds or revenue bonds issued by the Authority under the provisions of this Act are hereby made securities in which all public officers and bodies of this State and all municipalities and all municipal subdivisions, all insurance companies and associations and other persons carrying on an insurance business, all banks, bankers, trust companies, savings banks and savings associations, including savings and loan associations, building and loan associations, investment companies and other persons carrying on a banking business, all administrators, guardians, executors, trustees and other fiduciaries and all other persons whomsoever who are now or may hereafter be authorized to invest in bonds or other

obligations of the State may properly and legally invest funds including capital in their control or belonging to them. The bonds or revenue bonds of the Authority are also hereby made securities which may be deposited with and shall be received by all public officers and bodies of this State and all municipalities and municipal subdivisions for any purpose for which the deposit of the bonds or other obligations of this State is now or may hereafter be authorized.</p><p>Section 15. The purpose of the Authority is the redevelopment of the Downtown Marietta District, which includes but is not limited to renovation and rehabiliation of existing buildings, structures and improvements and acquisition and construction of new buildings, structures and improvements located in the Downtown Marietta District, all for any commercial, business, office, public or other use determined by a majority of the members of the Authority to further the redevelopment of the Downtown Marietta District. The purpose of the Authority is hereby declared to be an essential and public purpose, promoting the public good and welfare and benefitting the citizens of the Downtown Marietta District and the City of Marietta.

and other matters relative thereto; to provide for the repeal of this Act on a certain date; to repeal conflicting laws; and for other purposes.</fulltitle><p>Be it enacted by the General Assembly of Georgia:</p><p><b>Section 1.</b> An Act creating the State Court of Chatham County, approved December 18, 1819 (Ga. Laws 1819, p. 16), as amended, is hereby amended by adding following Section 17B a new Section 17C to read as follows:</p><p><blockquote><p>Section 17C. Pre-trial diversion. (a) As used in this Section, `pre-trial diversion' means procedures for postponing prosecution either temporarily or permanently at any point in the judicial process from the point at which the accused is to be charged until adjudication. The purpose of pre-trial diversion is to offer the offender an alternative method of rehabilitation, other than incarceration or probation which will bring about the offender's future compliance with the law.</p><p>(b) It shall be the policy of the State Court of Chatham County to use pre-trial diversion procedures in all first offender misdemeanor cases, except as otherwise provided in subsection (i) of this Section.</p><p>(c) For any offender subject to this Section, it shall be the duty of the Solicitor of the State Court to conduct a pre-trial diversion conference at which the Solicitor and the offender and defense counsel, if the offender is represented by counsel, may meet to discuss the case prior to the time a charge is made. At the diversion conference, the Solicitor shall afford either the offender or his counsel the opportunity to advance arguments and present facts bearing on the issues and shall inform the offender or his counsel of his views and the reasons therefor in a manner that will give the offender or his counsel the opportunity to respond thereto. The parties may discuss and agree upon a disposition of the case which may include dismissal or suspension of the prosecution. The parties may agree that a particular disposition shall be conditioned upon the offender's participating in a supervised rehabilitation program. The Solicitor shall, at any time, consult with a Judge of the State Court in determining an appropriate disposition of a case.</p><p>(d) In all cases where an individual is found eligible for diversion, a written report shall be made and retained on file in the Solicitor's office, regardless of whether the individual is finally

<page id="GA1980.2.P1401" no="GA1980.2.4382" />

rejected or accepted for a pre-trial diversionary program. A copy of this report shall be provided to the offender and the offender's counsel. In addition, copies may be provided to those agencies which may be involved in developing treatment programs with the offender. All parties concerned shall take due care to ensure the privacy of the pre-trial diversionary reports.</p><p>(e) The process of pre-trial diversion and the pre-trial diversion conference cannot be used to `coerce' a guilty plea from an offender, even though there is reasonable assumption of the offender's guilt. The offender, or an accused, shall not be required to enter any formal plea to a charge made against him as a condition for participation in a pre-trial diversion program. Participation in a pre-trial diversion program shall not be used in subsequent proceedings relative to a charge as evidence of an admission of guilt.</p><p>(f) In any case in which an offender agrees to a specific pre-trial diversion program, a specific agreement shall be made between the Solicitor and the offender. The Solicitor shall consult with a Judge of the State Court in determining the requirements of any such agreement. This agreement shall include the terms of the pre-trial diversion program, the length of the program, and a section therein stating the period of time after which the Solicitor will move either to dismiss the charge or to seek a conviction based upon that charge. This agreement must be signed by the offender and his counsel, if represented by counsel, and filed in the Solicitor's office. No pre-trial diversion or diversionary program will take place without the written consent of the offender.</p><p>(g) Prior to formal entry into a pre-trial diversion program, the Solicitor may require the offender to inform him concerning the offender's past criminal record, if any, his education and work record, his family history, and medical or psychiatric treatment or care he has received, any psychological test he has taken, and other information bearing on the Solicitor's decision as to an appropriate disposition of the case.</p><p>(h) If the case should go to trial, any statements made by an offender, or his counsel, in connection with any pre-charge discussions concerning pre-trial diversion shall not be admissible in evidence.</p><p>(i) An individual should not be considered for a pre-trial diversion program in those circumstances in which the individual has

<page id="GA1980.2.P1402" no="GA1980.2.4383" />

been known to be unresponsive to previous diversionary programs. A pre-trial diversion program should not be considered for those individuals which may be considered as `dangerous offenders.' The term `dangerous offender' as used herein shall mean a person who has committed an offense, whose history, character, and condition reveal a substantial risk that he will be a danger to others, and whose conduct has been characterized by a pattern of repetitive, compulsive, or aggressive behavior with heedless indifference to the consequences.</p><p>(j) The Solicitor of the State Court of Chatham County shall maintain a current and complete listing of various resource dispositions available for the purposes of the pre-trial diversion program. This listing shall be compiled and evaluated in conjunction with law enforcement agencies, correctional agencies, courts, and defense counsel. This listing shall be subject to periodic review and evaluation.</p></blockquote></p><p><b>Section 2</b>. This Act shall stand repealed in its entirety on July 1, 1982.</p><p><b>Section 3</b>.

In the discretion of the authority, any issue of such revenue bonds may be secured by a trust indenture by and between the authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or outside of the state. Such trust indenture may pledge or assign fees, tolls, revenues, and earnings to be received by the authority.

It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of this state to act as such depository and to furnish such indemnifying bonds or pledge such securities as may be required by the authority. Such indenture may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee and may restrict the individual right of action of bondholders as is customary in trust indentures securing bonds and debentures of corporations. In addition to the foregoing, such trust indenture may contain such other provisions as the authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust indenture may be treated as a part of the cost of maintenance, operation, and repair of the project affected by such indenture.</p><p><b>Section 15.</b> To whom proceeds of bonds shall be paid. The authority shall, in the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or in the trust indenture, provide for the payment of the proceeds of the sale of the bonds to any officer or person who, or any agency, bank, or trust company which, shall act as trustee of such funds and shall hold and apply the same to the purposes hereof subject to such regulations as this Act and such resolution or trust indenture may provide.</p><p><b>Section 16.</b> Sinking fund. The revenues, fees, tolls, and earnings derived from any particular project or projects, regardless of whether or not such fees, earnings, and revenues were produced by a particular project for which bonds have been issued, unless otherwise pledged and allocated, may be pledged and allocated by the authority to the payment of the principal and interest on revenue bonds of the authority as the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust instrument may provide; and such funds so pledged, from whatever source received, which said pledge may include funds received from one or more or all sources, shall be set aside at regular intervals as may be provided in the resolution or trust indenture into a sinking fund, which said sinking fund shall be pledged to and charged with the payment of: (a) the interest of the bonds as the same shall fall due; (b) the principal of the bonds as the same shall fall due; (c) any premium upon bonds acquired by redemption, payment, or otherwise; (d) the necessary charges of the

paying agent or agents for paying principal and interest; and (e) any investment fees or charges. The use and disposition of such sinking fund shall be subject to such regulations as may be provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the revenue bonds or in the trust indenture; but, except as may otherwise be provided in such resolution or trust indenture, such sinking fund shall be maintained as a trust account for the benefit of all revenue bonds without distinction or priority of one over another. Subject to the provisions of the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust indenture, any surplus monies in the sinking fund may be applied to the purchase or redemption of bonds; and any such bonds so purchased or redeemed shall forthwith be canceled and shall not be reissued, printed, and delivered.</p><p><b>Section 17.</b> Remedies of bondholders. Any holder of revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this Act or any of the coupons appertaining thereto and the trustee under the trust indenture, if any, except to the extent the rights herein given may be restricted by resolution passed before the issuance of the bonds or by the trust indenture, may, either at law or in equity, by suit, action, mandamus, or other proceedings, protect and enforce any and all rights under the laws of the State of Georgia or granted hereunder or under such resolution or trust indenture and may enforce and compel performance of all duties required by this Act or by such resolution or trust indenture to be performed by the authority or any officer thereof, including the fixing, charging, and collecting of revenues, fees, tolls, and other charges for the use of the facilities and services furnished.</p><p><b>Section 18.</b> Refunding bonds. The authority is hereby authorized to provide by resolution for the issuance of bonds of the authority for the purpose of funding or refunding any revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this Act and then outstanding, together with accrued interest thereon and premium, if any. The issuance of such funding or refunding bonds, the maturities and all other details thereof, the rights of the holders thereof, and the duties of the authority in respect to the same shall be governed by the foregoing provisions of this Act insofar as the same may be applicable.</p><p><b>Section 19.</b> Venue and jurisdiction. Any action to protect or enforce any rights under the provisions of this Act or any suit or

Bonds of the authority shall be confirmed and validated in accordance with the procedure of the Revenue Bond Law, as amended. The petition for validation shall also make party defendant to such action the State of Georgia or any municipality, county, authority, political subdivision, or instrumentality of the State of Georgia which has contracted with the authority for the services and facilities of the project for which bonds are to be issued and sought to be validated; and the state or such municipality, county, authority, political subdivision, or instrumentality shall be required to show cause, if any, why such contract or contracts and the terms and conditions thereof should not be inquired into by the court and the validity of the terms thereof be determined and the contract or contracts adjudicated as a part of the basis of the security for the payment of any such bonds of the authority. The bonds, when validated, and the judgment of validation shall be final and conclusive with respect to such bonds and the security for the payment thereof and interest thereon and against the authority issuing the same, the state and any municipality, county, authority, political subdivision, or instrumentality, if a party to the validation proceedings, contracting with the said Franklin County Water and Sewerage Authority.</p><p><b>Section 21.</b> Interest of bondholders protected. While any of the bonds issued by the authority remain outstanding, the powers, duties, or existence of said authority or of its officers, employees, or agents shall not be diminished or impaired in any manner that will affect adversely the interest and rights of the holders of such bonds; and no other entity, department, agency, or authority will be created which will compete with the authority to such an extent as to affect adversely the interest and rights of the holders of such bonds nor will the state itself so compete with the authority. The provisions of this Act shall be for the benefit of the authority and the holders of any such bonds and, upon the issuance of bonds under the provisions hereof, shall constitute a contract with the holders of such bonds.</p>

<p><b>Section 22.</b> Monies received considered trust funds. All monies received pursuant to the authority of this Act, whether as proceeds from the sale of revenue bonds, as grants or other contributions, or as revenues, income, fees, and earnings, shall be deemed to be trust funds to be held and applied solely as provided in this Act.</p><p><b>Section 23.</b> Tort immunity.

It shall be the duty of the authority to prescribe rules and regulations for the operation of the project or projects constructed under the provisions of this Act, including the basis on which water service and facilities, sewerage service and facilities, or both, shall be furnished.</p><p><b>Section 26.</b> Powers declared supplemental and additional. The foregoing sections of this Act shall be deemed to provide an additional and alternative method for the doing of the things authorized thereby and shall be regarded as supplemental and additional to powers conferred by other laws and shall not be regarded as in derogation of any powers now existing.

Partial pension. Any employee of said city who is not entitled to a pension as described in subsection (a), but who has been in the active service and on the payroll of said city for ten (10) years or more of which service five (5) years or more must have been immediately preceding the right to have benefits under this article and whose health during said period of service becomes totally and permanently impaired by reason of injury, ill health, age or infirmity shall, as a matter of right, be entitled to retire and receive from the pension fund hereby created for the period that such employee's health continues to be totally and permanently impaired, a disability pension in an amount proportionate to the total number of whole years of service to the city by such employees. The disability pension provided by this section shall be allowed without regard to the age of the employee entitled thereto. The amount of such disability pension shall be such proportionate part of the service pension allowed after twenty-five (25) years of service for an employee earning the same salary or wages that the number of whole years of service by such disabled employee bears to twenty-five (25) years. To illustrate, the amount of a disability pension based on an average monthly salary or wage of one hundred seventy-five dollars ($175.00) after fifteen (15) years of service to the city would be 15/25 of one-half () of one hundred seventy-five dollars ($175.00), or the sum of fifty-two dollars and fifty cents ($52.50) per month. The amount of a disability pension based on an average monthly salary or wage of two hundred twenty-five dollars ($225.00) would after nineteen and one-half (19-) years of service be 19/25 of one-half () of two hundred

twenty-five dollars ($225.00) per month or the sum of eight-five dollars and fifty cents ($85.50) per month. The amount of pension allowed for disability under this subsection shall never exceed the sum of thirteen hundred dollars ($1,300.00) per annum with respect to employees in the employ of the city prior to July 1, 1965, who retain their status in the pension plan of the city as said plan existed prior to the year 1965.</p></item><item><p>4. By adding to S. B. No. 79,  1, 4-8-65; Section 3-34(b) of the College Park Code the words, Pension benefits of the class of employees having retired under this section prior to July 1, 1979 shall be increased by the sum of one hundred dollars ($100.00) per annum, so that Section 3-34(b) shall read as follows:</p><p>Section 3-34. 1965 alternate pension plan. (b) Any officer or employee of the City of College Park who elects to come under the provisions of this section 1 of this amendatory Act of 1965 [this section], and the several subsections hereof, or who becomes employed by said city subsequent to the effective date of this act, [this section] and who retires as a matter of right, shall be entitled to receive a service pension in an amount equal to two per cent (2%) of the first three hundred dollars ($300.00) of his average monthly salary, plus one and one-half per cent (1-%) of his average monthly salary over three hundred dollars ($300.00), multiplied by the number of years of service. For example, an employee who retires as a matter of right after twenty-five (25) years of service, whose average monthly salary is five hundred dollars ($500.00), is entitled to a monthly pension in the amount of two hundred twenty-five dollars ($225.00) determined as follows: two per cent (2%) of the first three hundred dollars ($300.00) of average monthly salary equals six dollars ($6.00). One and one-half per cent (1-%) of the average monthly salary over three hundred dollars ($300.00) (which excess is two hundred dollars ($200.00) in this illustration) equals three dollars ($3.00). The sum of six dollars ($6.00) and three dollars ($3.00) thus obtained or nine dollars ($9.00) is then multiplied by twenty-five (25) (the number of years of service) to arrive at the monthly pension of two hundred twenty-five dollars ($225.00). Pension benefits of that class of employees having retired under this section prior to July 1, 1979 shall be increased by the sum of one hundred dollars ($100.00) per annum.</p></item>

B. 206 by Representative Pinkston of the 100th</p><p>House Bill 206 changes the venue for suits brought against corporations. During the legislative process an amendment inadvertently has permitted the possibility of a corporation being sued in contract in any county in which the corporation has an office even though that county has

<page id="GA1980.2.P1770" no="GA1980.2.4752" />

not the slightest nexus with the contract. This is an unwise circumstance; therefore, I have vetoed House Bill 206.</p></attachment><attachment><p>Veto No. 13H. B. 463 by Representatives Johnson of the 74th, Buck of the 95th, Wilson of the 19th and others</p><p>House Bill 463 amends the Act which provides for a health insurance program for public school employees to add to those eligible to participate in the program classroom aides, paraprofessionals and non-certified administrative and clerical personnel of all public school systems. Senate Bill 145 is an identical version of House Bill 463. Senate Bill 145 has been approved by me. Therefore, I have vetoed House Bill 463 to avoid an unnecessary duplication.</p></attachment><attachment><p>Veto No. 14H. B. 895 by Representatives Harris of the 8th, Battle of the 124th and Logan of the 62nd</p><p>House Bill 895 is designed to more clearly establish a public policy statement concerning the authority and responsibility of the State Board of Education to develop standards for programs in teacher certification. The original thrust of the bill espoused an acceptable philosophical approach to the solution of the problem presently being experienced and evoked by a proposed course of action by the State Board of Education in this regard. However, as the bill was subsequently amended and passed, it is my belief that more confusion concerning the issue would result if the bill were allowed to become law. Additionally, school systems would not be permitted to employ as teachers graduates of out-of-state colleges or universities unless such institutions are accredited by the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education. Georgia presently recruits many talented teachers from out-of-state institutions who are not so accredited. The problems which subsequently arose by the rewriting of the original version of House Bill 895 were unintended. Prior to taking this veto action, I have counseled with those most closely affected and responsible for the programs and the consequences connected with the proposed solution embraced within House Bill 895 as introduced. I am persuaded that the difficulties which provoked the introduction of this bill are capable of resolve without the necessity of legislative intervention. If not, I will look with favor upon a proposal which does not contain the problems present in this bill.</p></attachment>

<attachment><p>Veto No. 15H. B. 1099 by Representatives Cason of the 96th, Buck of the 95th, Thompson of the 93rd and others</p><p>House Bill 1099 would establish criteria for programs of evaluation prior to implementation of certain projects to be undertaken by the Department of Medical Assistance which govern the reimbursement of licensed hospitals for the cost of providing medical assistance. This bill would severely impair the effectiveness of the State to design, develop and implement cost containment programs which are intended to help bring under control the costs of health services. The concerns of the hospital industry which provoked the introduction and passage of this legislation have been recognized and appropriate administrative actions have been implemented which will afford to the industry adequate opportunity to become informed of any proposed new policy or program, to submit their reaction and to adequately evaluate the impact upon the hospital's fiscal policy. With these safeguards, the constraints which would otherwise be imposed upon effective cost containment projects should not be permitted, and I have accordingly vetoed House Bill 1099.</p></attachment><attachment><p>Veto No. 16H. B. 1121 by Representatives Snow of the 1st, Murphy of the 18th and Thompson of the 93rd</p><p>House Bill 1121 was one of a package of bills sponsored by the Code Revision Commission preparatory to the adoption in 1981 of a new Code. Through inadvertence a perfecting amendment to the bill was omitted. Therefore, the author of House Bill 1121 has requested that I veto the bill because of technical problems which would have otherwise resulted if the measure were allowed to become law. I have acceded to the author's request.</p></attachment><attachment><p>Veto No. 17H. B. 1153 by Representatives Lambert of the 112th, Hatcher of the 131st, Nichols of the 27th and others</p><p>As a result of other legislative measures which have been adopted and approved at the 1980 session of the General Assembly, the responsibility for training fire fighting personnel previously exercised by the Georgia Fire Academy will be transferred to the Board of Public Safety. Eventually when constructed and completed, fire fighting personnel will receive their training at the proposed comprehensive public safety training facility to be located in Monroe County. House Bill 1153 was an administration bill to add as an additional member of the Board of Public Safety a

<page id="GA1980.2.P1772" no="GA1980.2.4754" />

fire fighter. The addition of a fire fighter to the Board would more than adequately have provided the necessary input of fire fighters' interests into the Board's responsibility concerning their training. Despite repeated agreements by these interests with me that one additional member was sufficient, House Bill 1153 was amended and passed to add two members to the Board of Public Safety to come from the membership of the Georgia State Firemen's Association. For the foregoing reasons, there will be no member of the Firemen's Association on the Board of Public Safety.</p></attachment><attachment><p>Veto No. 18H. B. 1210 by Representatives Buck of the 95th, Harris of the 8th and Daugherty of the 33rd</p><p>House Bill 1210 provides an increase of 15.5 percent in retirement benefits available to members of the Superior Court Clerks' Retirement Fund. No corresponding increase in member contributions to the retirement fund or other appropriate increase in measures which fund the payment of retirement benefits were accomplished. The maximum required employee contribution to the fund of $18.00 has not been changed in 17 years. Previously, I have given my approval to House Bill 104 which enhances the joint-survivorship benefits to recipients of benefits of the fund. Based upon sound actuarial projections, I am advised that if House Bill 1210 were also approved, the situation could arise that within one year the retirement fund could be experiencing unfunded liabilities. For these reasons I have not permitted House Bill 1210 to become law. I am informed that at the next session of the General Assembly, an actuarially sound program to increase retirement benefits for members of the Superior Court Clerks' Retirement Fund will be introduced.</p></attachment><attachment><p>Veto No. 19H. B. 1301 by Representatives Burruss of the 21st, Carrell of the 75th and Marcus of the 26th</p><p>House Bill 1301 is a comprehensive bill intended to provide through expanded training and new procedures an improved property tax administration. Many of the features of the bill are laudable and should result in better property tax administration; others, however, have the potential to be counterproductive to good tax administration and merit more intense scrutiny and evaluation before being allowed to become law. The more troublesome and disturbing features of the bill relate to a fundamental change and departure in the methods for the evaluation of public utility property. Presently the value of public utility property is

<page id="GA1980.2.P1773" no="GA1980.2.4755" />

determined by the State Revenue Commissioner and the State Board of Equalization, if the taxpayer is dissatisfied. House Bill 1301 allows for the first time local boards of tax assessors a voice in determining the value of the utility's property. This concept in and of itself is not the problem, but rather the manner in which local boards are given this authority and the implications which necessarily flow from the course embarked upon by the bill. Many questions are raised by the various provisions of the bill for which no answers are provided. Particularly troublesome is the unresolved question of what would be the proper venue for an appeal of the decision of the Board of Equalization if a local board of tax assessors has appealed the Revenue Commissioner's determination. The preoccupation which the potential for the large number of appeals which are made possible by this fundamental change in utility taxation could inhibit and indeed paralyze the Revenue Department's ability to administer the complex annual evaluation and assessment of public utility property in future years. If this were to occur, chaos and disaster could surface in many counties and municipalities if these local governments should be denied in a timely manner the vital and essential source of revenue which enables these units of governments to provide basic and essential governmental services. Before a change in direction of the magnitude contemplated within this legislation is embarked upon, the full impact and all possible implications should be thoroughly analyzed and evaluated and answers found for the questions raised for which there are presently no answers. Because the changes wrought by the bill insofar as public utility taxation are concerned would not become effective until the next calendar tax year, I deem it to be the more prudent and responsible position to afford to the Tax Reform Commission the time to reassess all of the implications in its recommended course of action contained within House Bill 1301 rather than dealing with potential problems as they might arise in the future and perhaps suffering the consequences which might be devastating. Accordingly, I have reluctantly vetoed House Bill 1301.</p></attachment><attachment><p>Veto No. 6H. B. 1500 by Representatives Childs of the 51st, Collins of the 144th and Williamson of the 45th</p><p>House Bill 1500 would require that a tax at the rate of one percent of the gross direct premiums received from life insurance policies written on persons who reside in the un-incorporated areas of this State be levied and collected by each county governing authority. Each life insurance company would have been permitted to deduct from its obligation to pay a state premium tax a figure corresponding

<page id="GA1980.2.P1774" no="GA1980.2.4756" />

the tax directed to be levied by this bill. The State treasury would thus lose an estimated 10 million dollars annually. The granting of a tax authority to counties at the expense of State revenues at this critical economic juncture is not prudent and is unwise, and I have therefore vetoed House Bill 1500.</p></attachment><attachment><p>Veto No. 20H. B. 1578 by Representatives Marcus of the 26th, Collins of the 144th and Harris of the 8th</p><p>House Bill 1578 requires that the Department of Medical Assistance formulate a plan which will allow Georgia residents who are 65 years or older regardless of their financial status to purchase prescription drugs for their use from pharmacists without paying the applicable State and local sales and use tax imposed upon the transaction. After properly maintaining the necessary tax records and accomplishing the requisite accounting procedures, the pharmacist may deduct from his State sales tax liability a figure which corresponds to the tax not paid on the purchase. The overall objective sought to be accomplished by the bill is to relieve the elderly of the burden, if any, of the sales and use tax which is otherwise applicable. Whether it can be argued successfully that the payment of a sales tax on prescription drugs is a burden to the well-to-do or extremely wealthy elderly resident is doubtful. Unquestionably, the measure would provide some relief to low income elderly residents who are required to expend an inordinate amount of their disposable income on medicine. I am in complete sympathy with the desire to relieve this class of citizens of some of their tax burdens. I have previously approved of legislation which will allow those who qualify to defer a portion of their ad valorem property tax payments. Unfortunately, our Constitution prohibits the enactment of a scheme contemplated by House Bill 1578. Even though this measure, because of its unconstitutionality cannot be brought to fruition, the very same relief from any burden imposed upon the elderly by the sales tax on prescriptions can be afforded very simply and effectively without the necessity of imposing upon the pharmacist additional record-keeping and accounting burdens by simply exempting such transactions from the sales and use tax.</p></attachment></div>

to receive gratuitously credit for prior service thereby resulting in an increase of the former member's present retirement benefits. In order to protect the integrity of the various State retirement funds, it has been a longstanding policy that in order for credit for prior service be extended to members or former members of the funds, it must be accomplished on an equitable and sound actuarial basis. A departure from this policy is unwise and, therefore, I have properly prohibited such a departure from becoming effective in order to preserve the integrity of the fund.</p></attachment><attachment><p>Veto No. 8S. B. 338 by Senator Kidd of the 25th</p><p>Senate Bill 338 authorizes the Department of Transportation to acquire and maintain their own electronic data processing equipment and systems, independent of the centralized data processing services provided to other State departments and agencies by the Department of Administrative Services. Such a change, if permitted, would not be a wise and prudent course of action and would not be the most efficient utilization and manner of discharging the requirements and needs of D. O. T. in the data processing area. I am persuaded that the particular and unique data processing requirements of D. O. T., particularly in the area of engineering applications, are now more clearly understood and can be adequately addressed by D. O. A. S. in the future. Therefore, I have vetoed Senate Bill 338.</p></attachment><attachment><p>Veto No. 9S. B. 363 by Senators Starr of the 44th, Howard of the 42nd and Gillis of the 20th</p><p>Senate Bill 363 was an administration sponsored bill to add a consumer member to the Georgia Marriage and Family Counselor Licensing Board. During the legislative process, a number of substantive and unrelated amendments were added to the bill and several were deleted. After completing the legislative process, it is quite clear from the posture in which the bill has been presented to me for my executive action that the substantive features added to the original, as introduced version, of the bill have not been carefully or thoughtfully considered: e. g.the body of the bill does not conform to the title and serious errors of drafting form appear in the final version of the bill which place in doubt the validity of Senate Bill 363 if it were to be approved and allowed to become law. The evaluation of the board under the sunset review processes do not cause me to conclude that serious or irreparable harm to the public interest will occur if the Marriage and Family Counselor Licensing Act is allowed to terminate July 1, 1980. By this means the General Assembly in a more thoughtful and less cavalier

<page id="GA1980.2.P1777" no="GA1980.2.4759" />

fashion may in the future have the opportunity to evaluate the wisdom of whether the public interest can be best served by regulating and licensing any or all of the aspects associated with marriage and family counseling activities. For these reasons, I have vetoed Senate Bill 363.</p></attachment><attachment><p>Veto No. 10S. B. 498 by Senator Holloway of the 12th</p><p>The State Medical Education Board is presently provided for in Article X of the 1976 Constitution. In anticipation of the adoption by the General Assembly of a comprehensive revision of the 1976 Constitution, including Article X, recommended by the Select Committee on Constitutional Revision, Senate Bill 498 statutorily created the State Medical Education Board so that the revision project might delete from the new Constitution what is essentially statutory material. The effectiveness of Senate Bill 498 was contingent upon the ratification of a new Constitution. The General Assembly failed to adopt the necessary proposal to review the Constitution. Consequently the author of Senate Bill 498 has requested that I veto this bill, and I have done so.</p></attachment><attachment><p>Veto No. 11S.
