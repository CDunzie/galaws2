and may be made redeemable before maturity, at the option of the Authority, at such price or prices and under such terms and conditions as may be fixed by the Authority in the resolution providing for the issuance of the bonds. The Authority shall determine the form of the bonds, including any interest coupons to be attached thereto, and shall fix the denomination or denominations of the bonds and the place or places of payment of principal and interest thereof, which may be at any bank or trust company within or without the State.

All such bonds shall be signed by the Chairman of the Authority and the official seal of the Authority shall be affixed thereto and attested by the Secretary-Treasurer of the Authority and any coupons attached thereto shall bear the facsimile signature of the Chairman of the Authority. Any coupon may bear the facsimile signature of such person and any bond may be signed, sealed and attested on behalf of the Authority by such persons as at the actual time of the execution of such bond shall be duly authorized or hold the proper office, although at the date of such bond such persons may not have been so authorized or shall not have held such office. All revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this Act shall have and are hereby declared to have all the qualities and incidents of negotiable instruments under the negotiable instruments law of the State. Such bonds and the income thereof shall be exempt from all taxation within the State. The bonds may be issued in coupon or in registered form, or both, as the Authority may determine, and provision may be made for the registration of any coupon bond as to principal alone and also as to both principal and interest. The Authority may sell such bonds in such manner and for such price as it may determine

<page id="GA1939.1.P148" no="GA1939.1.151" />

to be for the best interests of the Authority, but no such sale shall be made at a price so low as to require the payment of interest on the money received therefor at more than four and one-quarter per cent per annum, computed with relation to the absolute maturity of the bonds in accordance with standard tables of bond values excluding, however, from such computation the amount of any premium to be paid on redemption of any bond prior to maturity. The proceeds of such bonds shall be used solely for the payment of the cost of the project of projects, and shall be disbursed upon requisition or order of the Chairman of the Authority under such restrictions, if any, as the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or the trust indenture hereinafter mentioned may provide. If the proceeds of such bonds, by error of calculation or otherwise, shall be less than the cost of the project or projects, unless otherwise provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust indenture, additional bonds may in like manner be issued to provide the amount of such deficit, which unless otherwise provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust indenture, shall be deemed to be of the same issue and shall be entitled to payment from the same fund without preference or priority of the bonds first issued for the same purpose. If the proceeds of the bonds of any issue shall exceed the amount required for the purpose for which such bonds are issued, the surplus shall be paid into the fund hereinafter provided for the payment of principal and interest of such bonds. Prior to the preparation of definitive bonds, the Authority may, under like restrictions, issue interim receipts, interim certificates or temporary bonds, with or without coupons exchangeable for definitive bonds upon the issuance of the latter. The Authority may also provide for the replacement of any bond which shall become mutilated or be destroyed or lost. Such revenue bonds may be issued without any other proceedings or the happening of any other conditions or things than those

proceedings, conditions and things which are specified or required by this Act. In the discretion of the Authority, revenue bonds of a single issue may be issued for the purpose of paying the cost of any one or more projects at any one institution. Any resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds under the provisions of this Act shall become effective immediately upon its passage and need not be published or posted, and any such resolution may be passed at any regular or special or adjourned meeting of the Authority by a majority of its members. <sidenote>Revenue bonds.</sidenote> <sidenote>Proceeds of bonds.</sidenote></p><p>Section 6. <i>Credit of State Not Pledged.</i> Revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this Act shall not be deemed to constitute a debt of the State of Georgia or a pledge of the faith and credit of the State, but such bonds shall be payable solely from the fund hereinafter provided therefor from earnings, and the issuance of such revenue bonds shall not directly or indirectly or contingently obligate the State to levy or to pledge any form of taxation whatever therefor or to make any appropriation for their payment. Neither the State nor the Authority shall be obligated to pay the principal of or the interest on such revenue bonds except from earnings of the project or projects for which they shall be issued. All such revenue bonds shall contain recitals on their face covering the foregoing provisions of this section. <sidenote>Bonds not debt of State.</sidenote></p><p>Section 7. <i>Trust Funds.</i> All moneys received pursuant to the authority of this Act, whether as proceeds from the sale of revenue bonds, as grants or other contributions, or as revenues and earnings, shall be deemed to be trust funds, to be held and applied solely as provided in this Act. The Authority shall, in the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or in the trust indenture, provide for the payment of the proceeds of the sale of the bonds and the earnings and revenues to be received to any officer who or any agency, bank or trust company, which shall act as trustee of such funds and shall hold and apply the same to

Such trust indenture may pledge or assign revenues and earnings to be received. Either the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or such trust indenture may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the Authority in relation to the acquisition of property, the construction of the project, the maintenance, operation, repair and insurance of the project, and the custody, safeguarding and application of all moneys, and may also provide that any project shall be constructed and paid for under the supervision and approval of consulting engineers or architects employed or designated by the Authority and satisfactory to the original purchasers of the bonds issued therefor, and may also require that the security given by contractors and by any depositary of the proceeds of the bonds or revenues or other moneys be satisfactory to such purchasers, and may also contain provisions concerning the conditions, if any, upon which additional revenue bonds may be issued. It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of this State to act as such depositary and to furnish such indemnifying bonds or pledge such securities as may be required by the Authority. Such indenture may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee, and may restrict the individual right of action of bondholders as is customary in trust indentures securing bonds and debentures of corporations. In addition to the foregoing, such trust indenture may contain such other provisions as the Authority may

<page id="GA1939.1.P151" no="GA1939.1.154" />

deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders.

Such rentals and other charges shall be so fixed and adjusted in respect of the aggregate thereof from the project or projects for which a single issue of revenue bonds is issued, as to provide a fund sufficient with other revenues of such project or projects, if any, to pay (a) the cost of maintaining, repairing and operating the project or projects, including reserves for extraordinary repairs and insurance, and other reserves required by the resolution or trust indenture, unless such cost shall be otherwise provided for, which cost shall be deemed to include the expenses incurred by the Authority on account of the project or projects for water, light, sewer and other services furnished by other facilities at such institution, and (b) the principal of the revenue bonds and the interest thereon as the same shall become due. The revenues and earnings derived from the project or projects for which a single issue of bonds is issued, except such part thereof as may be required to pay the cost of maintaining, repairing and operating the project or projects, and to provide such reserves therefor as may be provided for in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the revenue bonds or in the trust indenture, shall be set aside at such regular intervals as may be provided in such resolution or such trust indenture in a sinking fund which is hereby pledged to, and charged with the payment of, (1) the interest upon such revenue bonds as such interest

The use and disposition of such sinking fund shall be subject to such regulations as may be provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the revenue bonds or in the trust indenture, but, except as may otherwise be provided in such resolution or trust indenture, such sinking fund shall be a fund for the benefit of all revenue bonds without distinction or priority of one over another. Subject to the provisions of the resolution authorizing the issuance of the revenue bonds of the trust indenture, any moneys in such sinking fund in excess of an amount equal to one year's interest on all revenue bonds then outstanding may be applied to the purchase or redemption of bonds.

Such bonds and the income thereof shall be exempt from all taxation within the State.

If the proceeds of such bonds, by error of calculation or otherwise, shall be less than the cost of the project or projects, unless otherwise provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust indenture, additional bonds may in like manner be issued to provide the amount of such deficit, which unless otherwise provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust indenture, shall be deemed to be of the same issue and shall be entitled to payment from the same fund without preference or priority of the bonds first issued for the same purpose. If the proceeds of the bonds of any issue shall exceed the amount required for the purpose for which such bonds are issued, the surplus shall be paid into the fund hereinafter provided for the payment of principal and interest of such bonds. Prior to the preparation of definitive bonds, the Authority may, under like restrictions, issue interim receipts, interim certificates or temporary bonds, with or without coupons, exchangeable for definitive bonds upon the issuance of the latter.

The principal and interest of such revenue bonds shall be payable solely from the special fund herein provided for such payment.

All such bonds shall be signed by the Chairman of the

<page id="GA1939.1.P1334" no="GA1939.1.1340" />

Authority and the official seal of the Authority shall be affixed thereto and attested by the Secretary-Treasurer of the Authority and any coupons attached thereto shall bear the facsimile signature of the Chairman of the Authority. Any coupon may bear the facsimile signature of such person and any bond may be signed, sealed and attested on behalf of the Authority by such persons as at the actual time of the execution of such bond shall be duly authorized or hold the proper office, although at the date of such bond such persons may not have been so authorized or shall not have held such office. All revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this Act shall have and are hereby declared to have all the qualities and incidents of negotiable instruments under the negotiable instruments law of the State. Such bonds and the income thereof shall be exempt from all taxation within the State. The bonds may be issued in coupon or in registered form, or both, as the Authority may determine, and provision may be made for the registration of any coupon bond as to principal alone and also as to both principal and interest. The Authority may sell such bonds in such manner and for such price as it may determine to be for the best interests of the Authority, but no such sale shall be made at a price so low as to require the payment of interest on the money received therefor at more than six per centum per annum, computed with relation to the absolute maturity of the bonds in accordance with standard tables of bond values excluding, however, from such computation the amount of any premium to be paid on redemption of any bond prior to maturity. The proceeds of such bonds shall be used solely for the payment of the cost of the project or projects, and shall be disbursed upon requisition or order of the Chairman of the Authority under such restrictions, if any, as the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or the trust indenture hereinafter mentioned may provide. If the proceeds of such bonds, by error of calculation

<page id="GA1939.1.P1335" no="GA1939.1.1341" />

or otherwise, shall be less than the cost of the project or projects, unless otherwise provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust indenture, additional bonds may in like manner be issued to provide the amount of such deficit, which unless otherwise provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust indenture, shall be deemed to be of the same issue and shall be entitled to payment from the same fund without preference or priority of the bonds first issued for the same purpose. If the proceeds of the bonds of any issue shall exceed the amount required for the purpose for which such bonds are issued, the surplus shall be paid into the fund hereinafter provided for the payment of principal and interest of such bonds. Prior to the preparation of definitive bonds, the Authority may, under like restrictions, issue interim receipts, interim certificates or temporary bonds, with or without coupons, exchangeable for definitive bonds upon the issuance of the latter. The Authority may also provide for the replacement of any bond which shall become mutilated or be destroyed or lost. Such revenue bonds may be issued without any other proceedings or the happening of any other conditions or things than those proceedings, conditions and things which are specified or required by this Act. In the discretion of the Authority, revenue bonds of a single issue may be issued for the purpose of paying the cost of any one or more projects. Any resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds under the provisions of this Act shall become effective immediately upon its passage and need not be published or posted, and any such resolution may be passed at any regular or special or adjourned meeting of the Authority by a majority of its members. <sidenote>Bonds.</sidenote> <sidenote>Tax exempt.</sidenote> <sidenote>Proceeds.</sidenote></p><p>Section 6. <i>Credit of City Not Pledged.</i> Revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this Act shall not be deemed to constitute a debt of the City of Thomasville or a pledge of the faith and credit of the City, but such bonds shall

be payable solely from the fund hereinafter provided therefor from earnings, and the issuance of such revenue bonds shall not directly or indirectly or contingently obligate the City to levy or to pledge any form of taxation whatever therefor or to make any appropriation for their payment. Neither the City nor the Authority shall be obligated to pay the principal of or the interest on such revenue bonds except from earnings of the project or projects for which they shall be issued. All such revenue bonds shall contain recitals on their face covering the foregoing provisions of this section. <sidenote>Bonds not debt of city.</sidenote></p><p>Section 7. <i>Trust Funds.</i> All moneys received pursuant to the authority of this Act, whether as proceeds from the sale of revenue bonds, as grants or other contributions, or as revenues and earnings, shall be deemed to be trust funds, to be held and applied solely as provided in this Act. The Authority shall, in the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or in the trust indenture, provide for the payment of the proceeds of the sale of the bonds and the earnings and revenues to be received to any officer who or any agency, bank or trust company, which shall act as trustee of such funds and shall hold and apply the same to the purpose hereof, subject to such regulations as this Act and such resolution or trust indenture may provide. <sidenote>Funds as trust.</sidenote></p><p>Section 8. <i>Trust Indenture.</i> In the discretion of the Authority, any issue of such revenue bonds may be secured by a trust indenture by and between the Authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or outside of the State. Such trust indenture may pledge or assign revenues and earnings to be received. Either the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or such trust indenture may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not

It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the law of this State to Act as such depository and to furnish such indemnifying bonds or pledge such securities as may be required by the authority. Such indenture may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee, and may restrict the individual right of action of bondholders as is customary in trust indenture securing bonds and debentures of corporations. In addition to the foregoing, such trust indenture may contain such other provisions as the Authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust indenture may be treated as a part of the cost of maintenance, operation and repair of the project or projects affected by such indenture. <sidenote>Trust indenture.</sidenote> <sidenote>Protection to bondholders.</sidenote></p><p>Section 9. <i>Revenues and Earnings.</i> The authority is hereby authorized to fix and to revise from time to time fees, rentals and other charges for the use of each project and for the services and facilities furnished by the same and to charge and collect the same and to lease and to make contracts with any agency or Department of the State with respect to the use of any project or part thereof.

Such rentals and other charges shall be so fixed and adjusted in respect of the aggregate thereof from the project or projects for which a single issue of revenue bonds is issued, as to provide a fund sufficient with other revenues of such project or projects, if any, to pay (a) the cost of maintaining, repairing and operating the project or projects, including reserves for extraordinary repairs and insurance, and other reserves required by the resolution or trust indenture, unless such cost shall be otherwise provided for, which cost shall be deemed to include the expenses incurred by the Authority on account of the project or projects for water, light, sewer and other services furnished by other facilities at such institution, and (b) the principal of the revenue bonds and the interest thereon as the same shall become due. The revenues and earnings derived from the project or projects for which a single issue of bonds is issued, except such part thereof as may be required to pay the cost of maintaining, repairing and operating the project or projects, and to provide such reserves therefor as may be provided for in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the revenue bonds or in the trust indenture, shall be set aside at such regular intervals as may be provided in such resolution or such trust indenture in a sinking fund which is hereby pledged to, and charged with the payment of, (1) the interest upon such revenue bonds as such interest shall fall due, (2) the principal of the bonds as the same shall fall due, (3) the necessary charges of paying agents for paying principal and interest, and (4) any premium upon bonds retired by call or purchase as hereinabove provided. The use and disposition of such sinking fund shall be subject to such regulations as may be provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the revenue bonds or in the trust indenture, but, except as may otherwise be provided in such resolution or trust indenture, such sinking fund shall be a fund for the benefit of all revenue bonds without distinction or priority of one over another. <sidenote>Service charges.</sidenote> <sidenote>Application of revenue.</sidenote></p>
