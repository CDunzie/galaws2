<p><b>Section 14</b>. Credit not pledged. Revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this Act shall not be deemed to constitute a debt of Union County or a pledge of the faith and credit of said county, but such bonds shall be payable solely from the fund hereinafter provided for, and the issuance of such revenue bonds shall not directly, indirectly, or contingently obligate the said county to levy or to pledge any form of taxation whatever therefor, or to make any appropriation for the payment, and all such bonds shall contain recitals on their face covering substantially the foregoing provisions of this section.</p><p><b>Section 15</b>. Same; trust indenture as security. In the discretion of the authority, any issuance of such revenue bonds may be secured by a trust indenture by and between the authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or outside of the state.

Either the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or such trust indenture may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the authority in relation to the acquisition of property, the construction of the project, the maintenance, operation, repair, and insurance of the project, and the custody, safeguarding, and application of all moneys, and may also provide that any project shall be constructed and paid for under the supervision and approval of consulting engineers or architects employed or designated by the authority, and satisfactory to the original purchasers of the bonds issued therefor, and may also require that the security given by contractors and by any depository of the proceeds of the bonds or revenues or other moneys be satisfactory to such purchasers, and may also contain provisions concerning the conditions, if any, upon which additional revenue bonds may be issued. It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of this state to act as such depository and to furnish such indemnifying bonds or pledge such securities as may be required by the authority. Such indenture may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders as is customary in trust indentures securing bonds and debentures of corporations. In addition to the foregoing, such trust indenture may contain such other provisions as the authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust indenture may be treated as a part of the cost of maintenance, operation, and repair of the project affected by such indenture.</p>

Same, sinking funds. The revenues, fees, tolls, and earnings derived from any particular project or projects, regardless of whether or not such have been issued, unless otherwise pledged and allocated, may be pledged and allocated by the authority to the payment of the principal and interest on revenue bonds of the authority as the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust instrument may provide, and such funds not pledged, from whatever source received, which said pledge may include funds received from one or more or all sources, shall be set aside at regular intervals as may be provided in the resolution or trust indenture, into a sinking fund, which said sinking fund shall be pledged to and charged with the payments of (1) the interest upon such revenue bonds as such interest shall fall due, (2) the principal of the bonds as the same shall fall due, (3) the necessary charges of paying agents for paying principal and interest, and (4) any premium upon bonds retired by call or purchase as hereinabove provided. The use and disposition of such sinking funds shall be subject to such regulations as may be provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the revenue bonds or in the trust indenture, but, exce[UNK]pt as may otherwise be provided in such resolution or trust indenture, such sinking fund shall be a fund for the benefit of all revenue bonds without distinction or priority of one over another. Subject to the provisions of the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust indenture, surplus moneys in the sinking fund may be applied to the purchase or redemption of bonds and any such bonds so purchased or redeemed shall forthwith be canceled and shall not again be issued.</p><p><b>Section 18</b>.

<p>Veto No. 1H. B. 479 by Representatives Lawson, Wood and Jackson of the 9th</p><p>House Bill 479 is a charter for the City of Lula, Georgia. This is a local bill and due to technical defects in the legislation, the local delegation has requested that I veto the bill. For this reason, I am vetoing House Bill 479.</p><p>Veto No. 2H. B. 707 by Representative Groover of the 99th</p><p>House Bill 707 is an attempt to address a problem legislatively which simply cannot be addressed by action of the General Assembly, absent ratification by the people of this state. The Supreme Court of Georgia has ruled that the assertion of interests adverse to the state by state lawyer-legislators is violative of the fiduciary duty imposed by the people of this state. This fiduciary duty arises out of our state constitution which mandates that public officers are the trustees and servants of the people. No statutory enactment can modify the terms of this constitutional provision. This requires a constitutional amendment. For this reason, House Bill 707 is patently unconstitutional and I must veto it.</p><p>Veto No. 3H. B. 332 by Representatives Hasty of the 8th; Representative Darden of the 20th; and Representative Snow of the 1st</p><p>House Bill 332 amends the law establishing, by population bracketed categories, the minimum salary for clerks of the Superior Court in each county. It would raise the minimum salary for such clerks in counties which fell within one particular population bracket. Subsequent to the passage of H. B. 332, Senate Bill 182 passed which raised the minimum salary for clerks of the Superior Court in all population brackets. After speaking with the authors of H. B. 332, I have concluded that S. B. 182 is the preferable vehicle to address the problem which H. B. 332 was intended to address. For this reason, I am vetoing H. B. 332.</p>

<page id="GA1983.2.P1478" no="GA1983.2.4984" />

<p>Veto No. 4S. B. 225 by Senator Engram of the 34th</p><p>Senate Bill 225 provides for the release of patients' records by health service providers at the request of the patient. This bill was passed in the House by floor substitute with a floor amendment. The author of this bill objected to the House floor amendment. The House receded from its position with respect to the entire bill, thus leaving the bill in the form it passed the Senate. As a result, critical provisions which were part of the House Committee amendment were left out of the bill. For this reason, the author has requested that I veto this bill.</p><p>Veto No. 5S. B. 91 by Senator Littlefield of the 6th</p><p>Senate Bill 91, in addition to containing certain procedural and technical defects, represents a concept which I cannot countenance and the public will not tolerate in this day in time.</p><p>Procedurally, this bill is constitutionally defective by virtue of being in violation of Article III, Section VII, Paragraph IV of the Georgia Constitution which provides that, No law shall pass which refers to more than one subject matter, or contains matter different from what is expressed in the title thereof. Nowhere in the title to this bill is there language which states that a retiree may return to work full-time for compenation with the University System without having his or her retirement benefits reduced or affected. The title, as did the original bill, refers to public officers and employees being authorized to teach evening sports and recreation courses within the University System under certain conditions. From no phrase or word in the title could the General Assembly glean that, by passage of this bill, they would be authorizing double dipping by state retirees.</p><p>Technically, this bill is in conflict with House Bill 606 which I recently signed into law. House Bill 606 totally revamps the code with respect to conflict of interests laws. The author of Senate Bill 91 had the foresight to have his original bill incorporated into House Bill 606 at the proper place. If signed into law, Senate Bill 91 would amend the definitional section of our new conflict of interests law and would make absolutely no sense due to cross-references to a subsection which no longer exists.</p>

<page id="GA1983.2.P1479" no="GA1983.2.4985" />

<p>Conceptually, I have serious problems with the floor amendment that was attached to Senate Bill 91 in the wanning days of the session. The floor amendment authorizes any retiree of the state to return to work as a teacher or instructor with the University System, full-time for full compensation, without affecting such person's retirement benefits. The floor amendment is, pure and simple, a retirement bill. It was not introduced during the first ten days of the session. It was not reviewed by either the Senate or House Retirement Committees. It had no fiscal note attached. In short, it did not traverse the ordinary legislative process retirement bills are required to go through.</p><p>Retired former employees of the state can presently return to the service of the state. As a general rule, however, retirement benefits are either suspended during such service or compensation for such service is reduced so that the retirement benefits plus the compensation received do not exceed the earnable compensation the retiree was receiving at his or her retirement. This is fair.</p><p>I recently sponsored and signed into law a bill which amended the Teachers' Retirement System to authorize retired teachers to return to the schools as part-time teachers' aides or as substitute teachers. This bill was reviewed by the House and Senate Retirement Committees, had a fiscal note attached and passed both houses. This will allow our school systems to draw on the wisdom and experience of retired teachers for minimal compensation while allowing the retired teacher to continue receiving retirement benefits. This is fair.</p><p>To permit the type of board scale double dipping that would be authorized by Senate Bill 91, in my opinion, is not fair. Furthermore, the public will not stand for it. It is this type of sweetheart legislation that erodes public confidence in government and makes the jobs of dedicated public servants harder. For these reasons, I must veto Senate Bill 91.</p><p>Veto No. 6H. B. 92 by Representative Colbert of the 23rd</p><p>House Bill 92 is an attempt to expand the scope of the crime of interference with government property to include the use of government property for an indecent purpose. The bill also provides

<page id="GA1983.2.P1480" no="GA1983.2.4986" />

that government property includes state property, county property, municipal property, local school district property or the property of any other political subdivision of this state. Inadvertently, property belonging to the various authorities of the state and local governments was not included. Much of the state's property is deeded in the name of the Georgia Building Authority and other authorities of the state. Due to this error, I must veto House Bill 92.</p><p>Veto No. 7S. B. 147 by Senator Walker of the 19th; Senator Cobb of the 28th; Senator English of the 21st and others</p><p>Senate Bill 147 requires state and local governmental agencies to give purchase and contract preference to domestic steel products in public works projects of more than $50,000.00, if the purchase price of the domestic steel is not more than 10 percent above the purchase price of nondomestic steel products. This bill would also allow the Governor to suspend the operation of the law if the preference proved to have a detrimental effect on the economy of this state.</p><p>I am not unmindful of the problems facing our ailing domestic steel industry and am not unsympathetic with their plight. This nation is currently facing some hard economic times. These hard economic times have probably exacerbated the problems of the domestic steel industry. Many states have established the type of product preferences represented by S. B. 147. In the long run, I believe that these types of policies which create artificial markets will prove detrimental, not only to the economies of the states that have enacted them, but to the domestic steel industry itself.</p><p>As Governor, I have committed myself to creating jobs for Georgians. This task involves attracting foreign industries and encouraging foreign trade and investment in Georgia. If S. B. 147 were signed into law, it would create a protectionist image for Georgia internationally and invite retaliatory policies by the nations we disfavor. This would seriously impede our efforts to bring new industry to this state and would mean fewer new jobs for Georgians.</p>

<page id="GA1983.2.P1481" no="GA1983.2.4987" />

<p>I think that wisdom dictates that I veto S. B. 147. Our national economy can ill afford to have the individual states, marching to the tunes of their own drummers, establishing international trade and importing policies. We would be well advised to allow our national government to establish these policies, based on what is best for the nation as a whole.</p></note></notediv>

<page id="GA1983.2.P1484" no="GA1983.2.4990" />

<p>Veto No. 8S. B. 165 by Senator Kidd of the 25th</p><p>Senate Bill 165 contains many provisions finetuning and updating our elections code with respect to voter registration and absentee voting. In addition to these provisions, Section 22 of the bill authorizes public utility corporations to establish and administer a political action committee in order to receive and solicit contributions to be used for the purpose of influencing the outcome of elections for public office. In this same section, there is a prohibition against a public utility corporation making any contribution to a political campaign. Thus, this bill would allow a public utility corporation to do indirectly, by political action committee, that which it cannot do directly. For the following reasons, I must veto Senate Bill 165.</p><p>Unlike private corporations, public utility corporations enjoy a protected status in Georgia. In return for the State granting public utility corporations monopolistic powers, the public utility corporations agree to be regulated by the State. It is the responsibility of the State to insure that the power granted to regulated public monopolies not be abused.</p><p>The relationship between the regulator and the regulated is a complex one. The legislative process is the arena in which this relationship is defined. By its very nature, the legislative process is a political one. By influencing the political process, the legislative process is necessarily influenced. I have a fundamental problem with allowing a public utility corporation to inject itself into the political process, directly or indirectly. I can think of no greater potential for abuse than to allow the regulated to hold sway over those who shape the regulatory environment. Even the appearance of impropriety should not be allowed to taint those upon whom quasi-public authority has been conferred.</p><p>I have no problem with any individual employee, officer or director employed by any public utility corporation making any type of contribution on his or her own behalf to any political campaign. This is their individual right to express their opinion on matters of concern.</p>

<page id="GA1983.2.P1485" no="GA1983.2.4991" />

<p>Veto No. 9S. B. 110 by Senator Brown of the 47th; Senator Kidd of the 25th and Senator Hill of the 29th</p><p>Senate Bill 110 amends the Legislative Retirement System so as to increase the retirement benefits, upon retirement, of members of that System. Presently, benefits upon retirement are calculated by multiplying the number of years of creditable service by sixteen dollars. Senate Bill 110 would increase that multiplier to twenty dollars.</p><p>I do not oppose reasonable increases in the Legislative Retirement System, or any other retirement system, when funds are available and when all systems are treated with relative sameness. I can think of no issue which has captured as much media and public attention during the first two months of my administration as the retirement benefits of public officials. I do not intend to foster or promote the growing public perception that public officials are using the State Retirement System to feather their own nests. This perception is not conducive to public confidence in their public officials and their government, and it simply cannot be perpetuated.</p><p>Under the present economic conditions, where increases are unable to be granted for other state retirement systems, I believe it would be improper to single out this system for an increase at this time. For this reason I must veto Senate Bill 110.</p><p>Veto No. 10S. B. 277 by Senator Gillis of the 20th; Senator Kennedy of the 4th and Senator Walker of the 19th</p><p>Senate Bill 277 requires state and local governmental agencies to give purchase and contract preference to Georgia manufactured lumber products in public works projects of more than $50,000.00. Unlike Senate Bill 147, such preference is not required if the purchase price of Georgia manufactured lumber products is higher than the purchase price of other domestic or foreign made lumber products. Like Senate Bill 147, however, Senate Bill 277 is in response to these difficult economic times in attempting to create an artificial market for Georgia manufactured lumber products.</p>

<page id="GA1983.2.P1486" no="GA1983.2.4992" />

<p>Presently, Georgia law expresses a preference, as far as may be reasonable and practical, for the purchase of materials, supplies and equipment which have been manufactured or produced in this state. This preference has been in existence since 1933. To legislatively reiterate this preference and, in addition, impose substantial administrative burdens regarding the determination of product origin on our state and local governmental agencies, at this time is not appropriate. For this reason, I must veto Senate Bill 277.</p><p>Veto No. 11S. B. 212 by Senator Garner of the 30th and Senator Barnes of the 33rd</p><p>Senate Bill 212 repeals that Code Section in the law which defines naturopathy. This Code Section was left over from a 1950 Act of the General Assembly which created the Board of Naturopathic Examiners. The provisions of the 1950 Act creating the Board were repealed in 1956; however, the aforestated Code Section was left in the law in order to define naturopathy for those persons who had been licensed by the Board prior to 1956.</p><p>In 1981, the Attorney General ruled that this Code Section did not allow persons to practice naturopathic medicine in the State of Georgia unless they had been previously licensed by the original Board. This ruling is presently the subject of litigation.</p><p>It was obviously the intent of the 1983 General Assembly to abolish the last vestige of the 1950 Act. Although I do not endorse or condemn naturopathy, I feel that it is premature to abolish this Code Section which is now in litigation. I think it only fair, to leave the legal issues, now in litigation, exactly as they were when the appeal was perfected from the district court ruling. For this reason, I must veto Senate Bill 212.</p><p>In taking this action, I am not in any way trying to take the side or justify the position that this Code Section allows unlicensed individuals to practice medicine or naturopathy in this state. I simply feel that in all fairness, we should allow the judicial process to run its course.</p>

<p>Veto No. 12H. B. 103 by Representative Padgett of the 86th and Representative Groover of the 99th</p><p>Houe Bill 103 amends the law relative to the reporting of child abuse so as to make it a misdemeanor for the news media to make public the name of any child who is reported to have been abused. Under present law, when it is discovered that a child under the age of 18 has been abused, it is the responsibility of the person who discovers such fact to report it to a child welfare agency, or in the absence of such agency, to an appropriate police authority or district attorney.</p><p>The United States Supreme Court has ruled that the state cannot restrict access to public records by the press. Reports made to child welfare agencies reporting child abuse are made confidential by law, thus such reports containing the names of children reported to be abused are not in the public domain and are properly excludable from public consumption. However, once the child abuse case has been turned over to the District Attorney for prosecution and the name of the child is contained in the indictment or other public record, the name of that child is in the public domain and the press cannot constitutionally be threatened with criminal sanctions for publishing it.</p><p>I am in complete agreement with the intent of the author of this bill. It is important that we protect the youthful victims of crime and abuse to the greatest extent legally possible and that we not further traumatize these child-victims. I am aware, however, that there are certain constitutional limitations imposed on the state when attempting to limit access to public records by the press.</p><p>Thus while the intent of this bill is admirable, the effect, I fear, is constitutionally impermissible. For this reason, I must veto House Bill 103.</p></note></notediv></part></body>
