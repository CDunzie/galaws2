<notediv><title><b>COMPILER'S NOTE</b><br set="CENTER" /></title><note><p>General Acts and Resolutions of the 1989 session of the General Assembly of Georgia will be found in Volume I beginning at page 1. <i>While Proposed amendments to the Constitution of the State of Georgia are usually grouped together in Volume I, no amendments were proposed in 1989</i>.</p><p>Local and Special Acts and Resolutions will be found in Volume II beginning at page 3501. Home rule actions by counties which were filed in the office of the Secretary of State during 1988 are printed in Volume II beginning at page 5109. Home rule actions by municipalities which were filed in the office of the Secretary of State during 1988 are printed in Volume II beginning at page 5129. Code Sections 21-3-60 through 21-3-64 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated allowed municipal governing authorities to adopt certain ordinances relating to terms of office and election of municipal officials. Such ordinances were required to be filed in the office of the Secretary of State by January 31, 1989. All ordinances adopted pursuant to these Code sections which were filed in the office of the Secretary of State are grouped together and printed in Volume II beginning on page 5349.</p><p>There are no numbered pages between 1807 and 3501. This allows both volumes to be compiled and printed simultaneously.</p><p>Indexes are printed in each volume and cover material in both volumes. The tabular indexes list matter by broad categories. The general index is a detailed alphabetical index by subject matter. Where it is possible to do so, general Acts have been indexed by reference to the titles of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated which they amend and the tabular index also contains a list of Code Sections which have been amended, enacted, or repealed.</p>

<page id="GA1989.2.P4" />

<p>Each Act is preceded by the Act number assigned by the Governor and the House Bill or Senate Bill number which it was given when introduced in the General Assembly. Each Resolution is preceded by the Resolution Act number assigned by the Governor and the House Resolution or Senate Resolution number. Each Act or Resolution which was signed by the Governor is followed by the approval date on which it was signed by the Governor.</p></note></notediv>

All revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this Act shall have and are declared to have all the qualities and incidents of negotiable instruments under the laws of the state.

All such bonds shall contain recitals on their face covering substantially the foregoing provisions of this section.</p><p><b>Section 14.</b> Trust indenture as security. In the discretion of the authority, any issuance of such revenue bonds may be secured by a trust indenture by and between the authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company inside or outside of the state.

It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of this state to act as such depository and to furnish such indemnifying bonds or pledge such securities as may be required by the authority. Such indenture may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee and may restrict the individual right of action of bondholders as is customary in trust indentures securing bonds and debentures of corporations. In addition to the foregoing, such trust indenture may contain such other provisions as the authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust indenture may be treated as a part of the cost of maintenance, operation, and repair of the project affected by such indenture.</p>

Any action to protect or enforce any rights under the provisions of this Act or any suit or action against such authority shall be brought in the Superior Court of Oglethorpe County, Georgia, and any action pertaining to validation of any bonds issued under the provisions of this Act shall likewise be brought in said court which shall have exclusive, original jurisdiction of such actions.</p><p><b>Section 20.</b> Validation.

The state or such municipality, county, authority, political subdivision, or instrumentality shall be required to show cause, if any, why such contract or contracts and the terms and conditions thereof should not be inquired into by the court, the validity of the terms thereof be determined, and the contract or contracts adjudicated as a part of the basis of the security for the payment of any such bonds of the authority. The bonds, when validated, and the judgment of validation shall be final and conclusive

While any of the bonds issued by the authority remain outstanding, the powers, duties, or existence of the authority or of its officers, employees, or agents shall not be diminished or impaired in any manner that will affect adversely the interests and rights of the holders of such bonds; and no other entity, department, agency, or authority will be created which will compete with the authority to such an extent as to affect adversely the interests and rights of the holders of such bonds nor will the state itself so compete with the authority. The provisions of this Act shall be for the benefit of the authority and the holders of any such bonds and, upon the issuance of bonds under the provisions of this Act, shall constitute a contract with the holders of such bonds.</p><p><b>Section 22.</b> Moneys received considered trust funds. All moneys received pursuant to the authority of this Act, whether as proceeds from the sale of revenue bonds, as proceeds of short-term loans, as grants or other contributions, or as revenues, income, fees, and earnings, shall be deemed to be trust funds to be held and applied solely as provided in this Act.</p><p><b>Section 23.</b> Tort immunity.

It shall be the duty of the authority to prescribe rules and regulations for the operation of the project or projects constructed under the provisions of this Act, including the basis on which water service and facilities shall be furnished.</p><p><b>Section 26.</b> Powers declared supplemental and additional. The foregoing sections of this Act shall be deemed to provide an additional and alternative method for the doing of the things authorized thereby and shall be regarded as supplemental and additional to powers conferred by other laws and shall not be regarded as being in derogation of any powers now existing. This Act does not in any way take from Oglethorpe County or any municipality located therein or any adjoining county the authority to own, operate, and maintain a water system or to issue revenue bonds as is provided in Article 3 of Chapter 82 of Title 36 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, known as the Revenue Bond Law.</p><p><b>Section 27.</b> Liberal construction of Act.

Such trust indenture may pledge or assign fees, tolls, charges, revenues, and earnings to be received by the authority. Either the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or such trust indenture may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the authority in relation to the acquisition of property, the construction of the project, the maintenance, operation, repair, and insurance of the project, and the custody, safeguarding, and application of all moneys; may also provide that any project shall be constructed and paid for under the supervision and approval of consulting engineers or architects employed or designated by the authority and shall be satisfactory to the original purchasers of the bonds issued therefor; may also require that the security given by contractors and by any depositary of the proceeds of the bonds or revenues or other moneys be satisfactory to such purchasers; and may also contain provisions concerning the conditions, if any, upon which additional revenue bonds may be issued. It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of this state to act as such depositary and to furnish such indemnifying bonds or pledge such securities as may be required by the authority. Such indenture may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee, and may restrict the individual right of action of bondholders

<page id="GA1989.2.P477" no="GA1989.2.3952" />

as is customary in trust indentures securing bonds and debentures of private corporations. In addition, such trust indenture may contain such other provisions as the authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust indenture may be treated as a part of the cost of maintenance, operation, and repair of the project affected by such indenture.</p><p><b>Section 17.</b> Same; to whom proceeds of bond shall be paid. The authority shall, in the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or in any trust indenture, provide for the payment of the proceeds of the sale of the bonds to any officer or person who or any agency, bank, or trust company which shall act as trustee of such funds and shall hold and apply the same to the purposes of this Act, subject to such regulations as this Act and such resolution or trust indenture may provide.</p><p><b>Section 18.</b> Same; sinking fund. The revenues, fees, tolls, charges, and earnings derived from any particular project or projects, regardless of whether or not such fees, tolls, charges, earnings, and revenues were produced by a particular project for which bonds have been issued, unless otherwise pledged and allocated together with any grant funds, may be pledged and allocated by the authority to the payment of the principal of and interest on revenue bonds of the authority as the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or the trust indenture may provide, and such funds so pledged from whatever source received, which pledge may include funds received from one or more or all sources, shall be set aside at regular intervals as may be provided in the resolution or trust indenture, into a sinking fund which shall be pledged to and charged with the payment of: (1) the interest on such revenue bonds as such interest shall fall due; (2) the principal of the bonds as the same shall fall due; (3) the necessary charges of paying agents for paying principal and interest; and (4) any premium upon bonds retired by call or purchase as hereinabove provided. The use and disposition of such sinking fund shall be subject to such regulations as may be provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the revenue bonds or in any trust indenture, but, except as may otherwise be provided in such resolution or trust indenture, such sinking fund shall be a fund for the benefit of all revenue bonds without distinction or priority of one over another. Subject to the provisions of the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or of any trust indenture, surplus moneys in the sinking fund may be applied to the purchase or redemption of bonds,

<page id="GA1989.2.P478" no="GA1989.2.3953" />

and any such bonds so purchased or redeemed shall immediately be canceled and shall not again be issued.</p><p><b>Section 19.</b> Same; remedies of bondholders. Any holders of revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this Act or any of the coupons appertaining thereto, and the trustee under the trust indenture, if any, except to the extent the rights given in this Act may be restricted by resolution passed before the issuance of the bonds or by any trust indenture, may, either at law or in equity, by action, mandamus, or other proceedings, protect and enforce any and all rights under the laws of the State of Georgia or granted under this Act or under such resolution or trust indenture, and may enforce and compel performance of all duties required by this Act or by such resolution or trust indenture, to be performed by the authority or any officer thereof, including the fixing, charging, and collecting of revenues, fees, tolls, and other charges for the use of the facilities and services furnished.</p><p><b>Section 20.</b> Same; refunding bonds. The authority is authorized to provide by resolution for the issuance of refunding bonds of the authority for the purpose of refunding any revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this Act and then outstanding, together with accrued interest thereon, and to refund any revenue bonds issued by any city, county, or authority with respect to any facilities to be acquired by the authority from any such city, county, or authority. The issuance of such revenue refunding bonds, the maturities and all other details thereof, the rights of the holders thereof, and the duties of the authority in respect to the same shall be governed by the provisions of this Act insofar as such provisions may be applicable.</p><p><b>Section 21.</b> Same; venue and jurisdiction. Any action to protect or enforce any rights under the provisions of this Act or any action against such authority shall be brought in the Superior Court of Lamar County, Georgia, and any action pertaining to validation of any bonds issued under the provisions of this Act shall likewise be brought in such court, which shall have exclusive, original jurisdiction of such actions.</p><p><b>Section 22.</b> Same; validation. Bonds of the authority shall be confirmed and validated in accordance with the procedure provided for in Article 3 of Chapter 82 of Title 36 of the O.C.G.A., the Revenue Bond Law, as now or hereafter amended. The petition for

<page id="GA1989.2.P479" no="GA1989.2.3954" />

validation shall also make party defendant to such action any municipality, county, authority, subdivision, or instrumentality of the State of Georgia or any other party which has contracted with the authority to furnish or receive the services and facilities of the water and sewerage system for which bonds are to be issued and sought to be validated, and such municipality, county, authority, subdivision, or instrumentality or other party shall be required to show cause, if any exists, why such contract or contracts and the terms and conditions thereof should not be inquired into by the court and the validity of the terms thereof be determined and the contract or contracts adjudicated as security for the payment of any such bonds of the authority. The bonds when validated and the judgment of validation shall be final and conclusive with respect to such bonds, against the authority issuing the same, and any municipality, county, authority, subdivision, instrumentality, or other party contracting with the authority.</p><p><b>Section 23.</b> Same; interest of bondholders protected. While any of the bonds issued by the authority remain outstanding, the powers, duties, or existence of the authority or of its officers, employees, or agents shall not be diminished or impaired in any manner that will affect adversely the interests and rights of the holders of such bonds, and no other entity, department, agency, or authority will be created which will compete with the authority to such an extent as to affect adversely the interests and rights of the holders of such bonds. The provisions of this Act shall be for the benefit of the authority and the holders of any such bonds, and upon the issuance of bonds under the provisions of this Act shall constitute a contract with the holders of such bonds.</p><p><b>Section 24.</b> Moneys received considered trust funds. All moneys received pursuant to the authority of this Act, whether as proceeds from the sale of revenue bonds, as proceeds of short-term loans, as grants or other contributions, or as revenues, fees, and earnings shall be deemed to be trust funds to be held and applied solely as provided in this Act.</p><p><b>Section 25.</b> Purpose of the authority. Without limiting the generality of any provisions of this Act, the general purpose of the authority is declared to be that of acquiring, equipping, constructing, maintaining, and operating adequate water supply, treatment, and distribution facilities and sewerage collection, treatment, and distribution facilities; making such facilities and the services thereof

<page id="GA1989.2.P480" no="GA1989.2.3955" />

available to public and private consumers and users located in Lamar County and its environs, including municipalities inside or outside such county, and to adjoining counties; extending and improving such facilities; and doing all things deemed by the authority necessary, convenient, and desirable for and incident to the efficient and proper development and operation for such type of undertakings.</p><p><b>Section 26.</b> Rates, charges, and revenues; use. The authority is authorized to prescribe, fix, and collect rates, fees, tolls, or charges and to revise from time to time and collect such rates, fees, tolls, or charges for the services, facilities, or commodities furnished, and in anticipation of the collection of the revenues of such undertaking or project, to issue revenue bonds as provided in this Act to finance in whole or in part the cost of the acquisition, construction, reconstruction, improvement, betterment, or extension of the water and sewerage system, and to pledge to the punctual payment of such bonds and interest thereon all or any part of the revenues of such undertaking or project, including the revenues of improvements, betterments, or extensions thereto thereafter made.</p><p><b>Section 27.</b> Tax-exempt status of authority. The properties of the authority, both real and personal, are declared to be public properties used for the benefit and welfare of the people of the State of Georgia and not for purposes of private or corporate benefit and income, and such properties and the authority shall be exempt from all taxes and special assessments of any city, county, or the state or any political subdivision thereof.</p><p><b>Section 28.</b> Rules and regulations for operation of projects. It shall be the duty of the authority to prescribe rules and regulations for the operation of the project or projects constructed under the provisions of this Act.</p><p><b>Section 29.</b> Powers declared supplemental and additional. The provisions of this Act shall be deemed to provide an additional and alternative method for the doing of the things authorized by this Act and shall be regarded as supplemental and additional to powers conferred by other laws, and shall not be regarded as in derogation of any powers now existing.</p><p><b>Section 30.</b> Liberal construction of Act.

<p>(d) Each year, upon notification, each owner of property on which taxes and interest have been deferred shall submit to the city clerk a list, and the current value, of all outstanding liens on the owner's homestead.

The solicitor and his staff shall perform the same functions in relation to matters within the jurisdiction of the Magistrate Court of Cobb County as they perform in relation to matters within the jurisdiction of the judges of the State Court of Cobb County.

The person receiving a majority of the votes cast for solicitor shall be elected and shall take office on January 1, 1973, for a term of four years and until his successor is elected and qualified. Thereafter, the solicitor for the State Court of Cobb County shall be elected at the general election immediately preceding the expiration of the term of the solicitor in office and shall be elected for a term of office of four years and until his successor is elected and qualified.</p><p>(b) (1) The compensation of the solicitor shall be $65,000.00 per year, payable in equal monthly installments from the funds of Cobb County.</p><p>(2) Said compensation shall be in lieu of any and all perquisites, fines, forfeitures, commissions, funds, moneys,

Said solicitor shall not engage in the private practice of law during the term of office for which he is elected.</p><p>(3) In addition to the salary provided by paragraph (1) of this subsection, the Cobb County governing authority shall from county funds pay to the Trial Judges and Solicitors Retirement Fund on behalf of the solicitor the 7  percent employee contribution which he is required to make to the fund under the general laws of this state. This paragraph shall not apply to, and the county shall not pay, the additional 2  percent contribution for spouses' benefits.</p><p>(c) Any vacancy which may occur in the office of solicitor of the State Court of Cobb County by death, resignation, or otherwise shall be filled by appointment by the Governor, in the manner a vacancy in the office of district attorney is filled pursuant to Code Section 45-5-3 of the O.C.G.A.</p><p>(d) The solicitor shall have the authority to appoint the same number of assistant solicitors as the number of judges of Division I and Division II of the State Court of Cobb County and the same number of additional assistant solicitors as the number of magistrates of the Magistrate Court of Cobb County, plus two additional assistant solicitors, one of whom shall be the chief assistant solicitor. The compensation of such assistant solicitors shall be determined by the solicitor, except that said compensation of such assistant solicitors, except the chief assistant solicitor, shall not be less than $17,000.00 per year nor more than 75 percent of the compensation of the solicitor, payable in equal monthly installments from the funds of Cobb County. The compensation of the chief assistant solicitor shall not be less than $17,000.00 per year nor more than 90 percent of the compensation of the solicitor and shall be paid in the same manner as all other assistant solicitors.

The solicitor shall, from time to time, notify the board of commissioners of Cobb County of the number of such personnel needed by his office, together with the suggested compensation to be paid each employee. However, it shall be within the sole discretion of the board to fix the compensation to be received by each employee in said office, except that the compensation of assistant solicitors shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of subsection (d) of this section.

Such trust indenture may pledge or assign fees, tolls, revenues, rents, receipts, earnings, or other funds to be received by the authority, including the proceeds derived from the sale from time to time of any surplus property of the authority, either real or personal. The resolution providing for the issuance of such bonds or the trust indenture may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee and may prescribe the procedure by which bondholders may enforce their rights. Such resolution or trust indenture may also provide that any project shall be constructed and paid for under the supervision and approval of consulting engineers or architects satisfactory to the trustee or to the bondholders, and may also require that the security given by any contractors and by any depository of the proceeds of the bonds or revenues or other moneys be satisfactory to such trustee or bondholders, and may also contain provisions concerning the conditions, if any, upon which additional revenue bonds may be issued <b>pari passu</b> with the revenue bonds initially issued pursuant to such resolution or trust indenture. It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of this state or any national banking association organized under the laws of the United States to act as such depository and to furnish such security as may be required by the authority.

This section is illustrative and does not limit the types of instruments which may secure or provide for any issue of bonds or the terms and provisions which any resolution adopted by the authority or any instrument executed by the authority may contain. Any resolution adopted by the authority or any indenture of trust, trust agreement, or other instrument executed by the authority may contain such terms and provisions as the authority shall approve. Such approval of the authority shall be conclusively established by the execution of any such resolution, indenture of trust, trust agreement, or other instrument by the chairman or vice-chairman of the authority and the attestation of such execution by the secretary and treasurer or any assistant secretary of the authority. Nothing in this section or this Act shall be construed to require for any issue of revenue bonds a trustee or a trust indenture, trust agreement, or similar instrument.</p><p><b>Section 13.</b> In addition to and not in limitation of other powers granted in this Act as to the issuance of revenue bonds and security for such bonds, the authority shall have the power to enter into any financial and contractual arrangements which it deems appropriate with users or owners of projects in order to provide security to bondholders and for such purposes it may also enter into joint agreements, arrangements, or trust indentures with such users or owners and a trustee or trustees under any trust indenture in order that funds may be procured to accomplish the purposes of this Act.</p><p><b>Section 14.</b> While any of the bonds issued by the authority remain outstanding, the powers, duties, or existence of the authority or of its officers, employees, or agents shall not be diminished or impaired in any manner that will adversely affect the interest and rights of the holders of such bonds.</p><p><b>Section 15.</b> All bonds of the authority issued under the provisions of this Act are declared to be issued for an essential public purpose and the said bonds and the income therefrom shall at all times be exempt from taxation within the state.</p><p><b>Section 16.</b> Any bonds or revenue bonds issued by the authority under the provisions of this Act are made securities in which all public officers and bodies of this state and all municipalities and all municipal subdivisions; all insurance companies and associations and other persons carrying on an insurance business; all banks,

All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust may be treated as a part of the cost of maintenance, operation, and repair of the project affected by such trust.</p><p><b>Section 16.</b> Venue of actions; jurisdiction. Any action to protect or enforce any rights under the provisions of this Act brought in the courts of the State of Georgia, shall be brought in the Superior Court of Dooly County, Georgia, and any action pertaining to validation of the bonds issued under the provisions of this Act shall be brought in said court, which shall have exclusive, original jurisdiction of such action.</p><p><b>Section 17.</b> Validation of bonds.

The petition for validation shall be brought against said authority and, in the event the payments to be made by any political subdivision under a contract entered into between the authority and such political subdivision are pledged as security for the payment of the bonds sought to be validated, such political subdivision shall also be required to show cause, if any exists, why such contract or contracts and the terms and conditions thereof should not be adjudicated to be in all respects valid and binding upon such defendants. It shall be incumbent upon such defendants to defend against adjudication of the validity and binding effect of such contract or contracts or be forever bound thereby. Notice of such proceedings shall be included in the notice of validation hearing required to be issued and published by the Clerk of the Superior Court of Dooly County, in which court such validation proceeding shall be initiated.

Any such bonds so purchased or redeemed shall forthwith be canceled and shall not again be issued.</p><p><b>Section 18.</b> Same; remedies of bondholders.

<p><b>Section 7.</b> Same; signatures; seal. In case any officer whose signature shall appear on any bonds or whose facsimile signature shall appear on any coupon shall cease to be such officer before the delivery of such bonds, such signature shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if such officer had remained in office until such delivery. All such bonds shall be signed by the chairman of the authority and the official seal of the authority shall be affixed thereto and attested by the secretary of the authority and any coupon attached thereto shall bear the facsimile signatures of the chairman and the secretary of the authority. Any coupon may bear the facsimile signatures of such persons and any bond may be signed, sealed, and attested on behalf of the authority by such persons as at the actual time of the execution of such bonds shall be duly authorized or hold the proper office, although at the date of such bonds such person may not have been so authorized or shall not have held such office.</p><p><b>Section 8.</b> Same; negotiability; exemption from taxation.

happening of any other conditions or things other than those proceedings, conditions, and things which are specified or required by this Act. In the discretion of the authority, revenue bonds of a single issue may be issued for the purpose of any particular project. Any resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds under the provisions of this Act shall become effective immediately upon its passage and need not be published or posted, and any such resolution may be passed at any regular or special meeting of the authority by a majority of its members.</p><p><b>Section 13.</b> Credit not pledged. Revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this Act shall not be deemed to constitute a debt of Morgan County or any municipality nor a pledge of the faith and credit of said county or any municipality; but such bonds shall be payable solely from the fund provided for in this Act and the issuance of such revenue bonds shall not directly, indirectly, or contingently obligate said county or any municipality to levy or to pledge any form of taxation whatever therefor or to make any appropriation for their payment. All such bonds shall contain recitals on their face covering substantially the foregoing provisions of this section.</p><p><b>Section 14.</b> Trust indenture as security. In the discretion of the authority, any issuance of such revenue bonds may be secured by a trust indenture by and between the authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company inside or outside the state. Such trust indenture may pledge or assign fees, tolls, revenues, and earnings to be received by the authority. Either the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or such trust indenture may contain such provisions for the protecting and enforcing of the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the authority in relation to the acquisition of property, the construction of the project, the maintenance, operation, repair, and insuring of the project, and the custody, safeguarding, and application of all moneys, and may also provide that any project shall be constructed and paid for under the supervision and approval of consulting engineers or architects employed or designated by the authority and satisfactory to the original purchasers of the bonds issued therefor and may also require that the security given by contractors and by any depository of the proceeds of the bonds or revenues or other moneys be satisfactory to such purchasers and may also contain provisions concerning the conditions, if any, upon which additional revenue bonds may be

issued. It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of this state to act as such depository and to furnish such indemnifying bonds or pledge such securities as may be required by the authority. Such indenture may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee and may restrict the individual right of action of bondholders as is customary in trust indentures securing bonds and debentures of corporations. In addition to the foregoing, such trust indenture may contain such other provisions as the authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust indenture may be treated as a part of the cost of maintenance, operation, and repair of the project affected by such indenture.</p><p><b>Section 15.</b> To whom proceeds of bonds shall be paid. In the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or in the trust indenture, the authority shall provide for the payment of the proceeds of the sale of the bonds to any officer or person who, or any agency, bank, or trust company which, shall act as trustee of such funds and shall hold and apply the same to the purposes of this Act, subject to such regulations as this Act and such resolution or trust indenture may provide.</p><p><b>Section 16.</b> Sinking fund. The revenues, fees, tolls, and earnings derived from any particular project or projects, regardless of whether or not such fees, earnings, and revenues were produced by a particular project for which bonds have been issued, unless otherwise pledged and allocated, may be pledged and allocated by the authority to the payment of the principal and interest on revenue bonds of the authority as the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or the trust instrument may provide. Such funds so pledged from whatever source received, including funds received from one or more or all sources, shall be set aside at regular intervals as may be provided in the resolution or trust indenture into a sinking fund which shall be pledged to and charged with the payment of:</p><p>(1) The interest upon such revenue bonds as such interest shall fall due;</p><p>(2) The principal of the bonds as the same shall fall due;</p><p>(3) The necessary charges of paying agents for paying principal and interest and other investment charges; and</p>

<page id="GA1989.2.P1206" no="GA1989.2.4681" />

<p>(4) Any premium upon bonds retired by call or purchase as provided in this section.</p><p>The use and disposition of such sinking fund shall be subject to such regulations as may be provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the revenue bonds or in the trust indenture but, except as may otherwise be provided in such resolution or trust indenture, such sinking fund shall be maintained as a trust account for the benefit of all revenue bonds without distinction or priority of one over another. Subject to the provisions of the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust indenture, any surplus moneys in the sinking fund may be applied to the purchase or redemption of bonds, and any such bonds so purchased or redeemed shall forthwith be canceled and shall not again be issued.</p><p><b>Section 17.</b> Remedies of bondholders. Any holder of revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this Act or any of the coupons appertaining thereto and the trustee under the trust indenture, if any, except to the extent the rights given in this Act may be restricted by resolution passed before the issuance of the bonds or by the trust indenture, may either at law or in equity, by suit, action, mandamus, or other proceedings, protect and enforce any and all rights under the laws of the State of Georgia or granted under this Act or under such resolution or trust indenture and may enforce and compel performance of all duties required by this Act or by such resolution or trust indenture to be performed by the authority or any officer thereof, including the fixing, charging, and collecting of revenues, fees, tolls, and other charges for the use of the facilities and services furnished.</p><p><b>Section 18.</b> Refunding bonds. The authority is authorized to provide by resolution for the issuance of bonds of the authority for the purpose of funding or refunding any revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this Act and then outstanding, together with accrued interest thereon and premium, if any. The issuance of such funding or refunding bonds, the maturities and all other details thereof, the rights of the holders thereof, and the duties of the authority in respect to the same shall be governed by the foregoing provisions of this Act insofar as the same may be applicable.</p><p><b>Section 19.</b> Validation. Bonds of the authority shall be confirmed and validated in accordance with the procedure of the Revenue Bond Law, Article 3 of Chapter 82 of Title 36 of the

<page id="GA1989.2.P1207" no="GA1989.2.4682" />

O.C.G.A. The petition for validation shall also make party defendant to such action the State of Georgia or any municipality, county, authority, political subdivision, or instrumentality of the State of Georgia which has contracted with the authority for the services and facilities of the project for which bonds are to be issued and sought to be validated; and the state or such municipality, county, authority, political subdivision, or instrumentality shall be required to show cause, if any exists, why such contract or contracts and the terms and conditions thereof should not be inquired into by the court and the contract or contracts adjudicated as a part of the basis for the security for the payment of any such bonds of the authority. The bonds when validated and the judgment of validation shall be final and conclusive with respect to such bonds and the security for the payment thereof and interest thereon and against the authority issuing the same and the state and any municipality, county, authority, political subdivision, or instrumentality, if a party to the validation proceedings, contracting with the said Morgan County Water Authority.</p><p><b>Section 20.</b> Venue and jurisdiction. Any action to protect or enforce any rights under the provisions of this Act or any suit or action against such authority shall be brought in the Superior Court of Morgan County, Georgia, and any action pertaining to validation of any bonds issued under the provisions of this Act shall likewise be brought in said court which shall have exclusive, original jurisdiction of such action.</p><p><b>Section 21.</b> Interest of bondholders protected. While any of the bonds issued by the authority remain outstanding, the powers, duties, or existence of said authority or its officers, employees, or agents shall not be diminished or impaired in any manner that will affect adversely the interests and rights of the holders of such bonds. No other entity, department, agency, or authority will be created which will compete with the authority to such an extent as to affect adversely the interests and rights of the holders of such bonds, nor will the state itself so compete with the authority. The provisions of this Act shall be for the benefit of the authority and the holders of any such bonds, and, upon the issuance of bonds under the provisions of this Act, shall constitute a contract with the holders of such bonds.</p><p><b>Section 22.</b> Moneys received considered trust funds. All moneys received pursuant to the authority of this Act, whether as proceeds from the sale of revenue bonds, as grants or other contributions, or as revenues, income, fees, and earnings, shall be deemed to be trust funds to be held and applied solely as provided in this Act.</p>

This Act shall be known and may be cited as the Chatham-Savannah Authority for the Homeless Act.</p><p><b>Section 2.</b> Findings. (a) It is found, determined, and declared that there are many homeless persons in the Chatham County-Savannah area; that the number of homeless persons is increasing; that in many instances, the homeless are victims of circumstances beyond their control and they are in need of effective public and private assistance; and that the existing and increasing number of homeless persons is detrimental to the health, welfare, morality, and economic prosperity of the Chatham County-Savannah community.</p>

<page id="GA1989.2.P1227" no="GA1989.2.4702" />

<p>(b) It is further found and determined that public and private agencies are less effective in dealing with the problems of the homeless because programs are not coordinated, evaluated, and administered in a systematic manner under a comprehensive plan.</p><p>(c) It is further found and determined that the citizens of the Chatham County-Savannah area are deeply concerned about homeless persons in their community and that a comprehensive approach to providing services and assistance for the homeless in the Chatham County-Savannah area will serve as an effective demonstration project for other communities of Georgia.</p><p>(d) Because of the findings and determinations described in subsections (a) through (c) of this section, it is further found that there is a need for the creation of a public authority to develop a comprehensive plan through which public and private agencies of Chatham County and the City of Savannah can deal effectively with the problems of the homeless of the community. It is further found that such a public authority should cooperate with and assist public and private agencies in implementing and carrying out such a comprehensive plan and in providing oversight, evaluation, and coordination of the various programs and activities of such comprehensive plan and that such public authority should exercise additional powers and duties as provided in this Act in connection with the development, implementation, and carrying out of such plan.</p><p>(e) It is further found, declared, and determined that the creation of the public authority provided for in this Act and the carrying out of its corporate purposes are in all respects valid charitable and public purposes within the provisions of the Constitution of Georgia in that developing more effective methods, programs, and services to deal with the problems of the homeless of Chatham County and the City of Savannah is of vital importance to not only that community but also as a demonstration project to other communities throughout Georgia where similar problems exist.</p><p><b>Section 3.</b> Definitions.

These revisions, while extensive, do not constitute a comprehensive revision of the charter of the city.

<page id="GA1989.2.P1442" no="GA1989.2.4917" />

However, the numerous amendments to the charter since its original enactment make it impracticable to carry out the current extensive but not comprehensive revisions to the charter without a full restatement of the charter. Accordingly, this Act sets out a restatement of the charter, with certain extensive revisions thereto, subject to the following guidelines for establishing legislative intent:</p><p>(1) Charter sections introduced by the parenthetical designation (Revision) are substantively amended by this Act, and in construing such sections they should be deemed to speak as of the effective date of this Act; and</p><p>(2) Charter sections introduced by the parenthetical designation (Restatement) are not substantively amended by this Act, and in construing such sections they should be deemed to speak as of the date or dates of the Acts indicated in the parenthetical references at the end of such sections.</p><p>(b) Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, this Act is intended to constitute a comprehensive restatement and revision of the charter, and any provision of former law omitted from this Act shall be deemed repealed.</p><p>(c) This Act is not intended to effect any change in the substantive law governing the Waycross Independent School District or the board of education thereof, and the substantive law relating thereto shall be continued in effect as it existed immediately prior to the effective date of this Act.</p><p>(d) No inference should be derived from the inclusion of an enacting clause in some restated sections of this Act but not in other restated sections or revised sections, such inclusion being merely a result of the style in which certain such sections were originally drafted; and it is intended that the general enacting clause of this Act apply with equal force to each and every section of the restated and revised charter.</p><p><b>Section 2.</b> An Act providing a new charter for the City of Waycross, approved August 17, 1909 (Ga. L. 1909, p. 1456), as amended, and the several amendatory Acts thereof, are hereby amended by striking all substantive provisions (except provisions relating to the Waycross Independent School District) of said 1909 Act and said amendatory Acts and inserting in lieu thereof new

(First) The mayor and commission of the City of Waycross are authorized and empowered to construct along any of the streets of said city, and over any private property, a sewer system to be known as a sanitary sewer system, and this authority may be exercised at different times and in different sections of said city, in streets where sewers are now laid or in new streets, in the manner and to the extent deemed best by said mayor and commission. In all cases where a sewer is laid along any street, an amount equivalent to the actual cost of laying such sewer of a sufficient size to meet the needs of the property abutting on such street shall be assessed pro rata upon the real estate abutting on each side of such street; and in consideration of the payment of such assessment, the owners of such real estate shall have the right to connect their property with said sewer. The remaining cost of such sewers shall be paid by the city out of any funds available for the purpose.</p><p>(Second) Said mayor and commission shall also have authority to assess against abutting property the cost of extending house connections to the property line at the time such sewers are laid. The cost of such connections shall be added to the cost of the construction of the sewers, and the total cost shall be assessed against such abutting property. In case any sewer is constructed through or over any private property along the

<p><blockquote><p>Section 2. Gwinnett County Recreation Authority. There is hereby created a body corporate and politic to be known as the Gwinnett County Recreation Authority, which shall be deemed to be a political subdivision of the State of Georgia and a public corporation by that name, style and title and said body may contract and be contracted with, sue and be sued, implead and be impleaded, complain and defend in all courts of law and equity, except that the Authority or the trustee acting under the trust indenture shall in no event be liable for any torts committed by any of the officers, agents and employees. The Authority is hereby granted the same exemptions and exclusions from taxes as are now granted to cities and counties for the operation of facilities similar to facilities to be operated by the Authority as provided under the provisions of this Act.</p><p>The Authority shall consist of members who shall be residents of Gwinnett County and who shall be appointed by the Board of Commissioners of Gwinnett County. Neither the chairman nor a member of the Board of Commissioners of Gwinnett County shall be a member of the Authority. The term of office of those members of the Authority who are serving upon the Authority on June 30, 1989, shall expire July 1, 1989, and upon the appointment of their respective successors. Those successors and all future successors shall be appointed by the members and chairman of the Board of Commissioners of Gwinnett County, with each member appointing two persons to be members of the Authority and the chairman appointing one person to be a member of the Authority. Any person thus appointed to serve as a member of the Authority shall serve for a term of office which expires upon the expiration of the term of office of the commissioner or chairman who appointed that person and upon the appointment and qualification of the respective successor to that member of the Authority.</p><p>Any member of the Authority may be selected and appointed to succeed himself. Immediately after such appointments, the members of such Authority shall enter upon their duties. Any vacancy on the Authority shall be filled in the same manner as was the original appointment of the member whose termination of membership resulted in such vacancy and the person so selected and appointed shall serve for the remainder of the unexpired term. The Authority shall elect one of its members as chairman and another member as vice-chairman and it shall

also elect a secretary and treasurer, who does not necessarily have to be a member of the Authority and if not a member he or she shall have no voting rights. A majority of the members of the Authority shall constitute a quorum. No vacancy on the Authority shall impair the right of the quorum to exercise all the rights and perform all the duties of the Authority. The members of the Authority shall be reimbursed for all actual expenses incurred in the performance of their duties out of funds of the Authority and in accordance with the same policies and procedures established by the Merit System Board of Gwinnett County for reimbursement of expenses of county employees in the classified service. The Authority shall make rules and regulations for its own government. It shall have perpetual existence.</p></blockquote></p><p><b>Section 2.</b> Said Act is further amended by striking subsection (b) of Section 3 thereof and inserting in its place a new subsection to read as follows:</p><p><blockquote><p>(b) The word `project' shall be deemed to mean and include the acquisition, construction, equipping, maintenance and operation of recreation centers and areas, including, but not limited to, playgrounds, parks, hiking, camping and picnicking areas and facilities, swimming and wading pools, lakes, golf courses, tennis courts, athletic fields and courts, club houses, gymnasiums, and the usual and convenient facilities appertaining to such undertakings and extensions and improvements of such facilities, the acquisition of parking facilities or parking areas in connection therewith, the acquisition of the necessary property therefor, both real and personal, and the lease and sale of any part or all of such facilities, including real and personal property, so as to assure the efficient and proper development, maintenance and operation of such recreation facilities and areas, deemed by the Authority to be necessary, convenient or desirable.</p></blockquote></p><p><b>Section 3.</b> Said Act is further amended by striking subsection (i) of Section 4 thereof and inserting in its place, a new subsection to read as follows:</p><p><blockquote><p>(i) To borrow money for any of its corporate purposes and to execute evidences of such indebtedness and to secure the same and to issue negotiable revenue bonds payable solely from funds pledged for that purpose, and to provide for the payment of the

same and for the rights of the holders thereof; but in no event shall revenue bonds or any other debt of the Authority be an obligation of Gwinnett County other than the one mill levied for recreational purposes. The aggregate amount of all debt, including but not limited to bonds, notes, and other indebtedness, authorized to be issued or incurred by the Authority shall not exceed $50 million. The amount of all debt of the Authority existing on July 1, 1989, shall be aggregated with the amount of new debt of the Authority issued or incurred after that date for purposes of the $50 million limitation, notwithstanding the payment or other satisfaction of any such debt by the Authority. The amount of debt incurred to fund or refund previously existing debt shall not be included within that $50 million limitation if the amount of the previously existing debt has already been included within the limitation, the term of the funding or refunding debt does not extend beyond the term of that previously existing debt, and the total interest on the funding or refunding debt does not exceed the total interest to be paid on the previously existing debt, but the principal amount of debt incurred in connection with such funding or refunding may exceed the principal amount being funded or refunded only to the extent necessary to reduce the total principal and interest payment requirements over the remaining term of the previously existing debt being funded or refunded. No new revenue bonds or indebtedness of the Authority may be issued or incurred unless such action is approved by both the Authority and the Board of Commissioners of Gwinnett County in a regularly scheduled meeting of such Authority and board, respectively.</p></blockquote></p><p><b>Section 4.</b> All laws and parts of laws in conflict with this Act are repealed.</p><div><title>NOTICE OF INTENTION TO<br set="CENTER">INTRODUCE LOCAL<br set="CENTER">LEGISLATION<br set="CENTER" /></br></br></title><p>Notice is given that there will be introduced at the regular 1989 session of the General Assembly of Georgia a bill to amend an Act creating the Gwinnett County Recreation Authority, approved April 17, 1975 (Ga.

In such a case, any Disability Retirement payments made prior to the date his Disability ceases or is declared to no longer exist shall be retained by the retiree and disregarded in computing any other benefit payable under this Plan.</p><p>Section 7.

OPTIONAL FORMS OF RETIREMENT INCOME<br set="CENTER" /></title><p>Section 1. Election of Optional Retirement Benefits. An unmarried Class 1 Participant, or a Class 2 or Class 3 Participant, may elect or may revoke a previous election and make a new election, at any time prior to his actual Retirement date, to have his Retirement benefit payable under one of the options hereinafter set forth in lieu of the Retirement benefit he is otherwise entitled to receive. The benefit shall be paid in accordance with the terms of such option elected. Election of any option shall be made by the Participant in writing and shall be subject to approval by JMEBS. Further, election of any option made by a Class 1 Participant shall be or become void if he is married at the time of such election, or becomes married subsequent to such election but prior to his actual Retirement.</p><p>Section 2. Description of Options. The amount of any optional retirement benefit set forth below shall be the Actuarial Equivalent of the amount of benefit that would otherwise be payable to the Participant under Article V.</p><p>OPTION A: <u>Joint and Survivor Option</u>. A decreased retirement benefit which shall be payable during the lifetime of the Participant and, if his Beneficiary should survive him, shall continue after his death during the lifetime of his Beneficiary

<page id="GA1989.2.P1679" no="GA1989.2.5156" />

in the same amount or in such smaller amount as the Participant may designate. If the Beneficiary does not survive the Participant, all payments shall cease at the death of the Participant and no further benefits will accrue to his estate or to other persons except as provided in Article VII, Section 2. This option shall be known as Option A. The retirement benefit under Option A shall be calculated in accordance with Article VIII, Section 2a or 2b, whichever is applicable.</p><p>OPTION B: <u>Period Certain and Life Option</u>. A decreased retirement benefit payable monthly to the Participant during his lifetime and, in the event of his death within a period of five (5), ten (10), fifteen (15), or twenty (20) years after his Retirement, the same monthly amount shall be payable for the balance of such period to a Beneficiary designated by him. If the Beneficiary does not survive the Participant all payments shall cease at the death of the Participant and no further benefits will accrue to his estate or to other persons except as provided in Article VII, Section 2. This option shall be known as Option B. The retirement benefit under Option B shall be calculated in accordance with Article VIII, Section 3.</p><p>OPTION C: <u>Social Security Option</u>. An increased retirement benefit, determined as of the Participant's Early Retirement Date, payable to him during his lifetime until his retirement benefits commence under the Federal Social Security Act, and a decreased retirement benefit payable thereafter for life in order to have a more level retirement income when such decreased retirement benefit is added to his primary benefits under the Federal Social Security Act. At the death of the Participant all payments will cease and no further benefits will accrue to the estate of the Participant or to other persons except as provided in Article VII, Section 2. This option shall be known as Option C. The Actuarial Equivalent factors to be applied in calculating benefits under Option C shall be those contained in Article VIII, Section 4a or 4b, whichever is applicable.</p><p>Section 3.

If an optional form of retirement payment available in this Article is chosen and the Beneficiary is other than the Participant's spouse, the Actuarial Equivalent present value of payments to be made to the Participant must be more than fifty percent (50%) of the Actuarial Equivalent of the present value of the total payments to be made to the Participant and his Beneficiary.</p></div><div><title>ARTICLE VII. DEATH OR TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT<br set="CENTER" /></title><p>Section 1. Death Prior to Retirement.</p><p>a. Upon becoming eligible for Participation in accordance with Article III, a Participant may designate one and only one Beneficiary on a form provided for that purpose. In so doing, he specifically provides thereby that in the event the Participant's employment or term of office is terminated by reason of his death prior to his Retirement, there shall be paid to his designated Beneficiary a monthly death benefit actuarially equivalent to the reserve required for the Participant's anticipated Normal Retirement benefit, or, at the election of said Beneficiary, a refund of the deceased Participant's Accumulated Contributions in lieu of a monthly death benefit. In calculating the Normal Retirement benefit under the provisions of this section, the following assumptions shall be used:</p><p>(1) The Participant's age at the time of his death is sixty-five (65), or his attained age if his attained age is greater than sixty-five (65); and,</p><p>(2) For Eligible Employees employed by the City or Library prior to 12/1, 1987, the Total Credited Service shall include the amount of Credited Service accrued prior to the date of the Participant's death plus one-half () of the Service between such date of death and what would otherwise have been the Participant's Normal Retirement Date. In no event shall the amount of Total Credited Service

<page id="GA1989.2.P1681" no="GA1989.2.5158" />

exceed the sum of the actual Service performed plus ten (10) calendar years; or,</p><p>(3) For Eligible Employees employed by the City or Library on or subsequent to 12/1, 1987, and for elected or appointed members of the Governing Authority, the Total Credited Service shall include the amount of Credited Service accrued prior to the date of the Participant's death.</p><p>The death benefit under this section shall be calculated in accordance with Article VIII, Section 5.</p><p>b. In no event shall the benefit payable hereunder to the surviving spouse of a Class 1 Participant be less than two-thirds () of such Participant's accrued Normal Retirement benefit unless said surviving spouse remarries, in which case his or her benefit shall be recalculated in accordance with the death benefit formula specified in paragraph a in this section, and any benefits payable to the remarried spouse subsequent to such remarriage shall be reduced accordingly.</p><p>c. Designation of a Beneficiary may be changed by the Participant in writing on a form provided for that purpose at any time prior to actual Retirement. Only the last such designation of a Beneficiary prior to Retirement shall have effect and any new designation of a Beneficiary invalidates, supersedes, and revokes any prior designation.</p><p>Section 2. Death After Retirement. Upon the death of a Participant subsequent to his Retirement, there shall be payable to the Participant's designated Beneficiary, a benefit to be determined as follows:</p><p>a. If a Class 2 or Class 3 Participant, or an unmarried Class 1 Participant has not elected an optional form of payment as provided in Article VI, or if he has elected an optional form of payment and his designated Beneficiary does not survive him, no further payment of any kind whatsoever shall be made at the death of the Participant, unless he shall die before the total sum of his Accumulated Contributions has been paid to him, in which case the balance shall be paid

<page id="GA1989.2.P1682" no="GA1989.2.5159" />

in a lump sum to his designated Beneficiary or estate.</p><p>b. If an unmarried Class 1 Participant, or a Class 2 or Class 3 Participant, has elected an optional form of payment as provided in Article VI, and his designated Beneficiary survives him, benefits shall be payable to the Beneficiary as provided by the option elected. If the Participant's Accumulated Contributions have not been paid prior to the death of the Participant and his Beneficiary, the balance shall be paid in a lump sum to his estate.</p><p>c. If a Class 1 Participant is married on his Retirement Date his spouse, to whom he is married on his Retirement Date, shall be his designated Beneficiary and if said designated Beneficiary survives the Participant he or she shall be entitled to a Retirement benefit equal to two-thirds () of the deceased Participant's Retirement benefit. Said Beneficiary's benefit shall terminate upon the death or remarriage of the Beneficiary. If a Class 1 Participant's spouse does not survive him, no further payment of any kind whatsoever shall be made at or subsequent to the death of the Participant, unless he shall die before the total sum of his Accumulated Contributions has been paid to him, in which case the balance shall be paid in a lump sum to his estate.</p><p>Section 3. Termination of Employment Before Retirement.</p><p>a. A Participant, other than an elected or appointed member of the Governing Authority, whose employment is terminated under any of the following conditions for any reason other than death or Retirement shall be entitled to a Vested Right in his Accrued Benefit. Payment of such Vested Retirement Benefit shall commence on the first day of the month following his Normal or Early Retirement Date at the option of the Participant and shall be payable on the first day of each month thereafter during the life of the Participant. The amount of such Monthly Retirement Benefit shall be computed in the manner prescribed for Normal or Early Retirement in Article V herein, but based upon his Final Average Earnings and Total Credited Service up to the Participant's date of Termination with the City or Library. The conditions for a Vested Retirement Benefit under this

<page id="GA1989.2.P1683" no="GA1989.2.5160" />

section shall be one of the following:</p><p>(1) A Class 1 Participant whose employment is terminated voluntarily or involuntarily shall be entitled to a Vested Benefit if he has completed a minimum of eight (8) years of Total Credited Service in the Plan (exclusive of any time credited for service as a member of the Armed Forces of the United States); or,</p><p>(2) A Class 2 or Class 3 Participant whose employment is terminated voluntarily or involuntarily shall be entitled to a Vested Benefit if he has completed a minimum of ten (10) years of Total Credited Service in the Plan (exclusive of any time credited for service as a member of the Armed Forces of the United States); or,</p><p>(3) A Participant whose employment is terminated because he is disabled shall be entitled to a Vested Benefit provided his Disability began on or before the Participant's date of Termination of employment. No Disability benefit shall be payable unless application for such benefit is made within one (1) year after employment is terminated as a result of such Disability, except when a delay is caused by a pendency of a Disability determination by the Social Security Administration.</p><p>b. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph a of this section, a Participant whose employment shall become terminated for any reason other than death or Retirement shall within sixty (60) days after such termination request that his Accumulated Contributions be withdrawn. Failure to make such request within the allotted time shall terminate the accrual of any further Interest.</p><p>c. If a Participant chooses, upon Termination, to withdraw his Accumulated Contributions from the Trust Fund, the provisions of paragraph a of this section shall be null and void and his Accumulated Contributions shall be returned within ninety (90) days of the receipt of his request by JMEBS.</p><p>d. A Participant may not withdraw from the Plan nor

<page id="GA1989.2.P1684" no="GA1989.2.5161" />

withdraw his Accumulated Contributions so long as he remains in the employment of the City or Library and he may not borrow against his Accumulated Contributions at any time.</p><p>Section 4. Termination of Employment Before Retirement; Portability.</p><p>a. A Participant, other than an elected or appointed member of the Governing Authority, whose employment is terminated either voluntarily or involuntarily for any reason other than death, Disability, or Retirement after one (1) year or more of participation in the Plan, shall have a right to a Vested Retirement Benefit under the conditions set forth below. Payment of such benefit shall commence, at the option of the Participant, on the first day of the month following his Normal or Early Retirement Date as prescribed in the Plan and shall be payable on the first day of each month thereafter, provided:</p><p>(1) That his next employer and each successive employer until he qualifies for Retirement under this Plan be a JMEBS employer which maintains a JMEBS Retirement Plan with a provision on portability that is the same or substantially similar to this section. Each break in employment between successive JMEBS employers shall not exceed 60 days; and</p><p>(2) That to be entitled to any benefits under the provisions of this Plan, the Participant must meet, through his Total Credited Service with all JMEBS employers prior to Retirement, the age, Service, and participation requirements for Normal or Early Retirement as provided for herein; and,</p><p>(3) That the amount of such Monthly Retirement Benefit shall be computed in the manner prescribed for Normal or Early Retirement in Article V herein, but based on his Final Average Earnings and Total Credited Service up to the Participant's date of termination of employment with the Employer.</p>

<page id="GA1989.2.P1685" no="GA1989.2.5162" />

<p>b. In the event the Participant's immediately preceding employment was with a JMEBS employer or employers, the service performed for such former employer or employers shall be used for the purpose of qualifying the Participant for Retirement under this Plan. In no event shall service with another JMEBS employer be used to calculate the benefit amount due the Participant from this Employer.</p><p>c. In the event the Employer is his final JMEBS employer and the Plan allows Delayed Retirement beyond the Normal Retirement Date, the benefit under this section shall begin when the Participant retires and shall be computed as prescribed in Article V, Section 3.</p><p>d. If a Participant chooses, upon Termination, to withdraw his Accumulated Contributions from the Trust Fund, the provisions of this section shall be null and void and his Accumulated Contributions shall be returned within ninety (90) days of the receipt of his request by JMEBS.</p><p>Section 5. Termination of Tenure of Office Before Retirement. A Participant who is an elected or appointed member of the Governing Authoirty whose tenure of office is terminated shall be entitled to a Vested Benefit if he has completed a minimum of five (5) years of Total Credited Service in the Plan (exclusive of any time credited for service as a member of the Armed Forces of the United States). A Participant who is an elected or appointed member of the Governing Authority who has Credited Service as a Full-Time Employee of the Employer, shall have a vested right to his Credited Service both as a Full-Time Employee and as an elected or appointed member of the Governing Authority, provided his Total Credited Service equals at least ten (10) years. If such Total Credited Service is less than ten (10) years, the Participant's vested right shall be limited to his tenure of office as an elected or appointed member of the Governing Authority, provided his Total Credited Service as an elected or appointed member of the Governing Authority equals at least five (5) years.</p></div>

Other forms of benefit payment made upon plan termination or, if required for compliance with Section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code, shall be computed on the basis of the actual age of the Participant or Beneficiary at the time of distribution and under the following actuarial assumptions:</p><p>a. Interest: Rates that would be used to value the benefits for a Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation trusteed single-employer plan which terminates on the first day of the plan year in which the distribution is made.</p><p>b.

to Retired Participants, Beneficiaries, and other Participants.</p><p>a. The Employer expects the Plan to be continued indefinitely but, of necessity, reserves the right to terminate the Plan and Contributions thereunder at any time by action of the Governing Authority. Such termination shall be accomplished by the adoption of an ordinance by the Governing Authority terminating the Plan.

The benefits of each class shall be satisfied before proceeding to the next class. If at any time the remaining Plan assets would be insufficient to provide the present value of

<page id="GA1989.2.P1699" no="GA1989.2.5176" />

In the event of an involuntary termination, the members of the Governing Authority shall become successor trustees for the Plan.</p><p>c. The Board shall notify the Governing Authority, Participants, and Beneficiaries in writing of an involuntary termination and the reasons therefore. Said notice shall also fix a termination date. Payment of benefits to Retired Participants and Beneficiaries shall become the responsibility of the Governing Authority, as successor trustees, as of the termination date.</p><p>d. The Board, in accordance with its current rules and regulations, shall cause to be prepared, an audit of the JMEBS Investment Fund in accordance with generally accepted accounting practices to determine the value of the Trust Fund as of the termination date. The Board shall then deduct from the Trust Fund the total expenses incurred or to be incurred by JMEBS in terminating the Plan.

The Governing Authority hereby declares that it would have passed the remaining parts of this agreement or retained the previously existing provisions if it had known that such part or parts hereof would be declared or adjudicated invalid or unconstitutional.</p><p>Section 2. Non-Alienation of Benefits. None of the benefits, payments, proceeds or distributions payable under the Plan shall be subject to the claim of any creditor of any Participant or to the claim of any creditor of any Beneficiary hereunder, or to any legal process of levy or attachment by any creditor of any such Participant or Beneficiary; and no such benefits shall be in any manner liable for or subject to the debts, liabilities, engagements, or torts of any Participant or Beneficiary; and neither any such Participant or Beneficiary shall have any right to alienate, commute, anticipate, transfer, encumber, pledge, or assign any of the benefits, payments, proceeds, or distributions under the Plan.</p><p>Section 3.

manner acceptable to it, that such person is incompetent or a minor, and that a guardian or other person legally vested with the care of his estate has been appointed. In the event a guardian of the estate of any person receiving or claiming benefits under the Plan shall be appointed by a court of competent jurisdiction, payments shall be made to such guardian provided that proper proof of appointment is furnished in a form and manner suitable to the Pension Committee. Any payment so made shall be a complete discharge of liability therefore under the Plan.</p><p>Section 4. Benefits Supported Only by Trust Fund.

The Employer and the Pension Committee shall be the only necessary parties to any action or proceeding involving any rights under the Plan or the proper administration thereof, and no Participant, Beneficiary, or other persons having or claiming to have an interest in the Plan shall be entitled to any notice of process.</p><p>Section 7. Claims. Any payment to a Participant or Beneficiary,

Application for Benefits. Any provision in the Plan to the contrary notwithstanding, benefits may become payable only after the Participant, Beneficiary, or their legal representative, whichever is applicable, has made written application therefor to the Pension Committee. Benefits to which a Terminated Participant is entitled for which no such application has been made within three (3) years of his Normal Retirement Date shall be forfeited. Benefits to which a Beneficiary is entitled for which no such application has been made within three (3) years of the Participant's date of death shall be forfeited.

L. 1962, p. 3215, so as to create and establish a comprehensive street improvement program in the City of Dalton; to provide for the improvement of City streets, avenues, drives, alleys and other public places in the City of Dalton, and to improve the same by engineering, grading, draining, paving, curb and guttering and installing utilities; to provide for the procedure for such street improvements, and for making and collecting of assessments for same; to provide for the payment of such improvements entirely by the abutting and adjacent property owners on the basis of twenty (20%) percent yearly of five (5) years; to provide for the issuance of bonds by the City of Dalton by its Mayor and Council to be known as Street improvement Bonds; and to provide for the repayment of same; to repeal conflicting laws and ordinances; and for other purposes.</p><p>A synopsis of the proposed Ordinance is as follows:</p><p>The Ordinance will be known as The City of Dalton Street Ordinance of 1987. The Act provides that the City of Dalton,

<page id="GA1989.2.P1840" no="GA1989.2.5317" />

by its Mayor and Council is authorized and empowered to establish and change the grade of any streets, drives, avenues, alleys, and other public places in the City of Dalton and to improve the same by engineering, grading, draining, paving, curb and guttering, the installing utilities in the same whenever in its judgment the public convenience and welfare may require such improvements subject only to limitations described in the Ordinance.</p><p>The Ordinance provides that if the owners of all of the front feet of the land liable to assessment for any such improvements shall petition the City of Dalton for such improvement of any street or part of street, ally, drive, or avenue, or other public place described in the petition, the character of the improvement desired, the width of the same and the materials preferred by the petitioner for such improvement, and the Mayor and the Council determine that the street improvements would be in the public interest, it would then be the duty of the City of Dalton, by its Mayor and Council to promptly cause the improvements to be made in accordance with the petition. The Ordinance provides however that two or more streets may be treated as one street, and the improvement shall constitute one project and shall be dealt with accordingly as to resolutions, ordinance or petition of property owners or other proceedings.</p><p>The lots, pieces or parcels of land fronting and abutting upon both sides of any improvement shall be charged with the cost thereof, and each property owner shall pay his pro rata portion of the entire cost on his particular street or streets improvement in one project according to the linear frontage of the property owned by each property owner on the portion of the streets improved. Whenever the petition is presented by the property owners, the Mayor and Council shall have the power to enact all Ordinances and to establish all such rules and regulations as may be necessary to require the owners of all property subject to the assessment to pay the entire cost of any improvements, and to cause to be put in and constructed all water, gas or sewer pipe in and underneath the streets, drives, avenues, alleys, and all other public places where such public improvements are to be made and all costs and expenses for making such connection shall be taxed

<page id="GA1989.2.P1841" no="GA1989.2.5318" />

against the property and shall be included and made a part of the general assessment to cover the cost of the improvements.</p><p>After presentation of the petition by the property owners, the Mayor and Council shall adopt a resolution expressing the determination of the City to proceed with the improvement, stating the material to be used in the manner of construction, and defining the extent, character and width of the improvement, and any other matters as may be necessary to instruct the agent or engineer of the City in the performance of his duties and preparing for such improvements. The resolution shall set forth any such reasonable terms and conditions as the City shall deem proper to impose with reference to letting the contract and the provisions therefor and the City shall by resolution provide that the contractor shall execute to the City a good and sufficient bond in an amount to be stated in the resolution, conditioned for the full and faithful performance of the work and the performance of the contract, and for the protection of the City and all property owners interested against any loss or damage by reason of the negligence or improper execution of the work, and may require a bond in an amount to be stated in such resolution for the maintenance of good condition of such improvement for a period of not less than one (1) year from the time of its completion, or both, in the discretion of the City.</p><p>As soon as the contract or contracts are awarded and the cost of the improvements, which shall include all other expenses incurred by the City incident to such improvements in addition to the contract price of the work and materials, is ascertained, the Mayor and Council, shall by resolution, appoint a Board of Appraisers to appraise and apportion the cost and expense of the improvement to the several tracts of land abutting on such improvement. Within ten (10) days from the date of the resolution appointing the Board, the Board shall file a written report of the appraisal of the assessment and apportionment of such expense and cost to the several lots and tracts of land abutting on such street, alley, avenue or other public place so improved, with the Clerk of the City. When the report has been returned and filed, the City shall appoint a time for the holding of the session of the Mayor

<page id="GA1989.2.P1842" no="GA1989.2.5319" />

and Council, or shall designate a regular meeting of the Mayor and Council for the hearing of any complaints or objections that may be made concerning the appraisement, apportionment, and assessments as to any such lots or tracts of land abutting on the improvement, and notice of such session for the hearing shall be published by the City Clerk at least once a week for two (2) consecutive weeks in the daily newspaper, and the notice shall provide for an inspection of such return by any property owner or other party interested in the return. The time fixed for hearing shall not be less than five (5) nor more than (10) days from the last publication. The Mayor and Council at said session shall have the power to review and correct the appraisement, apportionment and assessment and to hear objections to it and to confirm the same either as made by the Board or as corrected by the Mayor and Council. Assessments in conformity to said appraisement and apportionment as confirmed by the Mayor and Council shall be payable in five (5) equal installments, and shall bear interest until paid, payable in each year at such time as the several installments of the assessments are made payable each year. The Mayor and Council shall by ordinance levy assessments in accordance with the appraisement and apportionment as so confirmed against the several tracts of land liable therefore, and shall cause the appraisement and apportionment to be recorded on the deed records of Whitfield County duly certified as correct by the Clerk of the Council; and when so recorded, the charges assessed against the various parcels of land shall become a first lien thereon, superior to all other liens except those to the State of Georgia, County of Whitfield and City of Dalton. Such liens shall continue until such assessment and interest thereof shall be fully paid, abut unmatured installments shall not be deemed to be within the terms of any general covenant or warranty.</p><p>The first installments of the assessments, together with interest to that date upon the whole shall be due and payable, one (1) year from the date of the Ordinance levying assessments, and one (1) installment with the yearly interest upon the amounts remaining unpaid shall be payable on the anniversary date of assessment Ordinance and each succeeding year until all shall be paid. The Ordinance shall also provide

<page id="GA1989.2.P1843" no="GA1989.2.5320" />

that the owners of the property so assessed shall have the privilege of paying the amounts of their respective assessment together with all interest due at any time, and relieve their property from the lien of the assessment, which money shall be paid to the City of Dalton.</p><p>After the passage of the Ordinance confirming and levying the assessments, the City of Dalton, by its Mayor and Council shall by resolution provide for the issuance of bonds in the aggregate amount of such assessment, bearing date fifteen (15) days after the passage of the ordinance levying the assessments, and of such denominations as the City shall determine which bond or bonds shall in no event become a liability of the City of Dalton, or its Mayor or Council issuing them. One-fifth (1/5) of any amount of any such series of bond with the interest upon the whole series to that date shall be payable yearly from the anniversary of the assessment date next succeeding the maturity of the first installment of the assessments, and interest, and one-fifth (1/5) thereof with the yearly interest upon the whole amount remaining unpaid shall be payable on the said anniversary date from their date until maturity, payable annually and shall be designated as Street Improvement Bond, and shall on the face thereof recite the street or streets, part of street or streets or other public places for the improvement of which they have been issued and that are payable solely from assessments which have been levied upon the lots and tracts of land benefited by the improvements under the authority of the act. The bond shall be signed by the City of Dalton, by the Mayor and attested by the Clerk of Council, and shall have the impression of the corporate seal of the City thereon, and all bonds issued by the authority of this act shall be payable to bearer in such place, either within or without the State of Georgia and shall be designated by the Mayor and Council. The bond shall be sold at not less than par, and the proceeds thereof applied to the payment of the contract price and other expenses by the Mayor and Council. The bonds may be registered by the Clerk of Council and a book to be provided for that purpose and Certificates of Registration by the Clerk of the City shall be endorsed upon each bond.</p><p>It will be the duty of the Clerk of Council to keep an adequate

account of all such collections of assessments and such collections shall be kept in a special fund to be used and applied for the payment of such bonds and for the interest thereon and for no other purpose.</p><p>The act provides that all laws and parts of laws conflicting therewith will be and the same are repealed.</p><p>A copy of the proposed amendment to the Charter of the City of Dalton establishing the City of Dalton Street Improvement Ordinance of 1987 is on file at the Office of the City Clerk of the City of Dalton and in the Office of the Clerk of the Superior Court of Whitfield County, Georgia for the purposes of examination and inspection by the public.</p><p>The Mayor and Council of the City of Dalton will consider the proposed Ordinance at two regular meetings to be held on July 20, 1987 and on August 3, 1987 at 7:30 o'clock P.M. in the Chambers of the Mayor and Council at City Hall, 114 Pentz Street, Dalton, Georgia.</p><p>This 15th day of July, 1987.</p><pre>/s/ JIMMY L.
