Said resolution may be adopted on one reading and need not be published. The report of the city engineer shall be recorded by the city clerk with said resolution in the book of ordinances and minutes of the commission; but the approval of the individual assessments against abutting property and against railroad companies, as entered in said assessment book, may be by reference in said resolution to the volume and page of the assessment book, so that said individual assessments need not be recorded in the book of ordinances and minutes.

The cost or contract price of making such repairs shall be charged against the abutting real estate, and constitute a lien thereon from the date of completing the work. If the amount of the assessment is not paid within thirty days of the completion of the work, the city treasurer shall issue an execution against the abutting real estate and the owner thereof, which execution shall be enforced as in cases of other assessments for street improvements. A certificate from the city manager setting forth the facts and describing the abutting property shall be sufficient warrant for the issuance of said execution.

<law id="R1929V1N476" initial.page="1527"><shorttitle>YALE UNIVERSITY AND ABRAHAM BALDWIN HONORED BY HOLIDAY.</shorttitle><lawnbr>No. 13.</lawnbr><p>Whereas, in this so-called materialistic age, this age of machinery, there are those who are still moved by a deep sense of appreciation and sentiment, and find occasion to pay tribute to those who have made the State great by contributing to its commercial, educational, and spiritual development; and <sidenote>Preamble.</sidenote></p><p>Whereas the immigrants from Europe, the migration of citizens from other States of our own country, have made their notable contributions to the welfare and progress of Georgia; perhaps no single institution has done so much to advance Georgia to the forefront in things of permanent value as Yale University. The graduates of Yale University early fell in love with Georgia, and many came from year to year, not to find land upon which to settle, but to found schools, colleges, churches, and to become leaders in the secular professions and pursuitsto be governors, lawyers, teachers, statesmen; and <sidenote>Recognition of services rendered Georgia by Abraham Baldwin and other graduates of Yale University.</sidenote></p><p>Whereas among the early graduates of Yale to settle in Georgia was that brilliant, staunch Puritan, Lyman Hall, who from the day of his arrival was prominent in the public life of the State. His intensely patriotic services to Georgia during the Revolutionary period are well known. He was a delegate to the Second Continental Congress, signed the Declaration of Independence, and was elected governor of Georgia. He was a loyal and typical Yale man greatly interested in religion and education; and</p><p>Whereas, as Governor, he urged the legislature to make provision for the endowment of seminaries of learning in the State, and in his first message to the legislature, July 8, 1783, said: Every encouragement ought to be given to introduce religion and learned clergy to perform divine worship in honor of God and to cultivate religion and virtue among our citizens. For this purpose it will be your wisdom to

<page id="GA1929.1.P1484" no="GA1929.1.1528" />

lay an early foundation for endowing seminaries of learning; nor can you, I conceive, lay better than by a grant of land that may, as in other governments, hereafter, by lease or otherwise, raise a sufficient revenue to support such valuable institutions; and</p><p>Whereas the next legislature acted by granting, in the law laying out Washington and Franklin Counties, 40,000 acres of land to endow a college or seminary of learning. A board of trustees of seven men was named, and among these was ex-Governor Nathan Brownson, another eminent graduate of Yale University; and still another remarkable graduate of Yale University, Abraham Baldwin, whose life and service to Georgia have been rescued from oblivion by the late Doctor H. C. White, for more than fifty years professor of chemistry in the State University; and</p><p>Whereas Abraham, Baldwin came to Georgia from Yale University at the invitation of General Nathaniel Greene and Governor Lyman Hall, settled in Wilkes County, and later represented that county in the legislature. Afterwards he was elected to Congress and to the Senate. He was an active and an important contributor to the building of Georgia, one of the group of wise men who laid securely the foundations upon which was builded the present great republic; and</p><p>Whereas that illustrious Georgian, Richard Malcolm Johnston, said of him: He was the greatest man that ever lived in Georgia. In some respects he was superior to Jefferson. Justice has never been done to his great merits. He wrote the charter of the University of Georgia, a document that contains sentiments as lofty, as sublime and as inspiring as any found in the Declaration of Independence; as for example, It should be among the first objects of those looking towards the national prosperity to support and encourage the principles of morality and religion, and thus early to place youth under the forming hand of society, that by instruction they may be moulded to love of virtue and good order; and</p>

<page id="GA1929.1.P1485" no="GA1929.1.1529" />

<p>Whereas Abraham Baldwin has the great honor of being the founder of the first of American State Universities and the first President of a State University; and</p><p>Whereas still another brilliant son of Yale came to Georgia to be the first active President of the University of Georgia, Josiah Meigs. He was given authority to select his own faculty, and of course selected Yale graduates; and</p><p>Whereas time will not permit to recite the contributions made by Yale graduates in other lines of activity, nor their full contributions to the educational system of Georgia; and</p><p>Whereas Yale University has done the University of Georgia the distinguished honor of accepting its invitation to send their football team to engage in a game which will dedicate the new stadium on October 12. It is such an unusual event for the Yale team to play at any field outside of New Haven, except Harvard or Princeton, that the University of Georgia has felt peculiarly complimented by their acceptance of its invitation, and are extremely anxious to make the occasion memorable in every way. Yale was prompted to accept the invitation because of its intimate kinship with Georgia; and <sidenote>Appreciation of attendance of Yale football team at dedication of State University Stadium, October 12.</sidenote></p><p>Whereas Dr. George H. Nettleton, chairman of the athletic board of control, Yale University, states: With the founding and development of this university Yale has most intimate connections. In recognition of such close academic kinship and of the special interest of Yale graduates in the South, exceptional consideration was paid to exceptional circumstances. The determining factor is not accidental rivalry for inter-sectional athletic supremacy, but settled community of academic interests and friendly regard; and</p><p>Whereas, in recognition of the great services rendered the State of Georgia by its many illustrious graduates of Yale University: Lyman Hall, Nathan Brownson, Abraham Baldwin, Josiah Meigs, and others, and in appreciation of the coming of Yale University to dedicate the new stadium of one of her childrenthe State University:</p>

<p>Therefore be it resolved, by the General Assembly of Georgia, that Saturday, October 12, be and the same is hereby designated a legal holiday for the year 1929, as a courtesy to Yale and in honor of the founder of the first of American State Universities, to be known as Abraham Baldwin Day. <sidenote>October 12 designated as legal holiday for 1929, to be known as Abraham Baldwin Day.</sidenote></p><approvaldate>Approved August 14, 1929.</approvaldate></law></lawdiv></part></body>
