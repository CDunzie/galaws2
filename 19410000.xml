The Authority shall determine the form of the bonds, including any interest coupons to be attached thereto, and shall fix the denomination or denominations of the bonds and the place or places of payment or principal and interest thereof, which may be at any bank or trust company within or without the State.

such delivery. All bonds shall be signed by the Chairman of the Authority and the official seal of the Authority shall be affixed thereto and attested by the Secretary-Treasurer of the Authority and any coupons attached thereto shall bear the facsimile signature of the Chairman of the Authority. Any coupon may bear the facsimile signature of such person and any bond may be signed, sealed and attested on behalf of the Authority by such persons as at the actual time of the execution of such bond shall be duly authorized or hold the proper office, although at the date of such bond such persons may not have been so authorized or shall not have held such office. All revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this Act shall have and are hereby declared to have all the qualities and incidents of negotiable instruments under the negotiable instruments of law of the State. Such bonds and the income thereof shall be exempt from all taxation within the State. The bonds may be issued in coupon or in registered form, or both, as the Authority may determine, and provision may be made for the registration of any coupon bond as to the principal alone and also as to both principal and interest. The Authority may sell such bonds in such manner and for such price as it may determine to be for the best interests of the Authority, but no such sale shall be made so low as to require the payment of interest on the money received therefor at more than six per centum per annum, computed with relation to the absolute maturity of the bonds in accordance with standard tables of bond values excluding, however, from such computation the amount of any premium to be paid on redemption of any bond prior to maturity. The proceeds of such bonds shall be used solely for the payment of the cost of the project or projects, and shall be disbursed upon requisition or order of the Chairman of the Authority under such restrictions, if any, as the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or the trust indenture hereinafter mentioned may provide. If the proceeds of such bonds, by error of calculation

or otherwise, shall be less than the cost of the project or projects unless otherwise provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust indenture, additional bonds may in like manner be issued to provide the amount of such deficit, which unless otherwise provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust indenture, shall be deemed to be of the same issue and shall be entitled to payment from the same fund without preference or priority of the bonds first issued for the same purpose. If the proceeds of the bonds of any issue shall exceed the amount required for the purpose for which such bonds are issued, the surplus shall be paid into the fund hereinafter provided for the payment of principal and interest of such bonds. Prior to the preparation of definitive bonds, the Authority may, under like restrictions, issue interim receipts, interim certificates or temporary bonds, with or without coupons exchangeable for definitive bonds upon the issuance of the latter. The Authority may also provide for the replacement of any bond which shall become mutilated or be destroyed or lost. Such revenue bonds may be issued without any other proceedings or the happening of any other conditions of things then those proceedings, conditions and things which are specified or required by this Act. In the discretion of the Authority, revenue bonds of a single issue may be issued for the purpose of paying the cost of any one or more projects at any one institution. Any resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds under the provisions of this Act shall become effective immediately upon its passage and need not be published or posted, and any such resolution may be passed at any regular or special or adjourned meeting of the Authority by a majority of its members. <sidenote>Revenue bonds.</sidenote></p><p>Section 6. <i>Credit of State Not Pledged.</i> Revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this Act shall not be deemed to constitute a debt of the State of Georgia or a pledge of the faith and credit of the State, but such bonds shall be

payable solely from the fund hereinafter provided from earnings, and the issuance of such revenue bonds shall not directly or indirectly or contingently obligate the State to levy or to pledge any form of taxation whatever threrefor or to make any appropriation for their payment. Neither the State nor the Authority shall be obligated to pay the principal on or the interest on such revenue bonds except from earnings or the project or projects for which they shall be issued. All such revenue bonds shall contain recitals on their face covering the foregoing provisions of this section. <sidenote>Credit of State not pledged.</sidenote></p><p>Section 7. <i>Trust Funds.</i> All moneys received pursuant to the authority of this Act, whether as proceeds from the sale of revenue bonds, as grants or other contributions, or as revenues and earnings, shall be deemed to be trust funds, to be held and applied solely as provided in this Act. The Authority shall, in the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or in the trust indenture, provide for the payment of the proceeds of the sale of the bonds and the earnings and revenues to be received to any officer who or any agency, bank or trust company, which shall act as trustee of such funds and shall hold and apply the same to the purposes hereof, subject to such regulations as this Act and such resolution or trust indenture may provide. <sidenote>Trust funds.</sidenote></p><p>Section 8. <i>Trust Indenture.</i> In the discretion of the Authority, any issue of such revenue bonds may be secured by a trust indenture by and between the Authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers or a trust company within or outside of the State. Such trust indenture may pledge or assign revenues and earnings to be received. Either the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or such trust indenture may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including

It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of this State to act as such depository and to furnish such indemnifying bonds or pledge such securities as may be required by the Authority. Such indenture may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustees, and may restrict the individual right of action of bondholders as is customary in trust indentures securing bonds and debentures or corporations. In addition to the foregoing, such trust indenture may contain such other provisions as the Authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders.

If the proceeds of such certificates, by error of calculation or otherwise, shall be less than the cost of the project or projects, unless otherwise provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the certificates or in the trust indenture, additional certificates may in like manner be issued to provide the amount of such

If the proceeds of the certificates of any issue shall exceed the amount required for the purpose for which such certificates are issued, the surplus shall be paid into the fund hereinafter provided for the payment of principal and interest of such certificates. Prior to the preparation of definite certificates, the Authority may, under like restrictions, issue interim certificates or temporary certificates, with or without coupons exchangable for definite certificates upon the issuance of the latter. The Authority may also provide for the replacement of any certificate which shall become mutilated or be destroyed or lost.

It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of this State to act as such depository and to furnish such indemnifying bonds or pledge such securities as may be required by the Authority. Such indenture may set forth the rights and remedies of the certificate holders and of the trustee, and may restrict the individual right of action of certificate holders as is customary in trust indentures securing bonds and debentures of corporations. In addition to the foregoing, such trust indenture may contain such other provisions as the Authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the certificate holders.
