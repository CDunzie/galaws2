In each case where the cost of improving the roadway or street proper is assessed against the abutting property and railroad companies, if any, without the city paying any portion thereof except for street intersections, the proceedings for such improvements shall be begun by petition to the mayor and council of said city, signed by the owners of more than fifty per cent. of the property abutting on the street or streets or portions of street or streets proposed to be improved. For the purpose of said petition, a holder of land under bond for title or similar instrument, a grantor in a security deed, and a fiduciary with power of sale shall be held to be the owner. A tenant in common may sign as the owner of frontage in proportion to his undivided interest. In determining the amount of property abutting on a street, the frontage in lineal feet shall govern; and in figuring said total frontage, areas lying within intersecting streets shall not be counted. Railroad companies having tracks lying on or along any street to be improved, and which may be required to pay a portion of the cost of such improvement as in this Act provided, shall not be parties to said petition, though said companies shall have the right to appear at any hearing of said petition and oppose said improvement; nor, for the purpose of determining whether owners of the required amount of property have signed said petition, shall the tracks of rights of way of said companies be counted. <sidenote>Proceedings.</sidenote></p><p>Said petition shall set forth the general character of improvement requested, the frontage of the property

Before said ordinance is read a second time and adopted, an advertisement shall be inserted by the city clerk in any newspaper in said city, such advertisement giving notice of the introduction of said ordinance, the location and general character of the proposed improvement, the general character of the material proposed to be used, and the estimated approximate cost to abutting property owners per front foot. Said advertisement shall be publicized at least ten (10) days before the date when said ordinance will be considered by the mayor and council for final passage and adoption. Said advertisemnt shall further state that the property owners or others interested are notified to appear at the meeting of the mayor and council, giving the time and place thereof, when said

After such hearing the mayor and council may, in its judgment, after a second reading of said ordinance, adopt and publish the same, as provided in cases of other ordinances of said city. A statement in or at the bottom of said ordinance, over the signature of the city clerk, or any other certificate of said city clerk, that said notice and opportunity for a hearing was duly given, shall be prima facie evidence of that fact. <sidenote>Same.</sidenote></p><p>Any number of streets or parts of streets may be included in one petition or ordinance and shall be considered as one improvement; but any objection to an improvement shall be made to each street separately.

Whenever the City of Dalton by its mayor and council, shall deem it necessary to make street improvements as hereinbefore provided, where no petition of property owners is necessary, the cost of such improvements shall be assessed by the mayor and council against the real estate abutting on each side of the street to be so improved; provided, that one-third ([frac13]) of the cost shall be borne by said city. Where an assessment is made against railroad companies, the amount of such assessment is to be deducted from the total cost, and the remainder is to be prorated granted against abutting property and the city as above. The entire cost of grading, paving, or otherwise improving sidewalks, curbs, and gutters (except cost charged against railroad companies) shall be assessed against the real estate abutting on the side of the street on which said sidewalk, curbs, or gutters are improved or constructed. The ordinance providing for the work and making the general assessment shall describe merely the general character of the improvement and the general character of the materials to be used, making reference for more details to specifications or plans in the office of the city engineer or clerk of the City of Dalton. <sidenote>Same.</sidenote></p><p>Section 7.

If the work is done under contract, the city shall advertise for bids, but shall not be required to accept the lowest bid where the mayor and council deems the acceptance of a higher bid to be to the city's best interests. On all contracts, the bond required by statute shall be given by the contractor, with surety thereon to be approved by the city mayor and council.

book of ordinances and minutes of the mayor and council; but the approval of the individual assessments against abutting property and against railroad companies, as entered in said assessment book, may be by reference in said resolution to the volume and page of the assessment book, so that said individual assessments need not be recorded in the books of ordinances and minutes. When said assessments have been so approved by resolution of the mayor and council, they shall be construed and presumed to have been made according to special benefits accruing to the property assessed. Any errors or omissions in the assessment book, whether in the description of property, names, dates, amounts, or otherwise may be corrected at any time, before or after the approval of the city engineer's report, which corrections may be made by resolution of the mayor and council or the mayor and council may, by ordinance or resolution, authorize such corrections to be made by any officer or employee of the city. <sidenote>Same, entires.</sidenote></p></item><item><p>(e) In cases of all assessments for improvements made under ordinances hereafter adopted by the mayor and council, the ordinance providing for the improvement and making the general assessment against abutting property and against railroad companies shall create an inchoate lien upon said abutting property and upon the property of said railroad companies located in said city; but said lien shall date, rank, and become fixed from and on the date of the passage of the resolution approving the entries in the assessment book as above provided, and in the amount set forth in said assessment book.

(a) Every person owning or holding property of any kind in any capacity within the corporate limits of the city, on the first Monday in February in each year after the passage of this act, shall return the same for taxation under oath at any time from and after the first Monday in February and until the first Monday in May of each year to the city clerk, or other officer authorized to receive tax returns for said city. <sidenote>Tax returns.</sidenote></p><p>(b) When the owner of property, or if dead or under any legal disability his representative or representatives, fails or refuses to make a return to the city clerk or other officer authorized to receive tax returns at the time the return should have been made, said clerk or other officer shall notify in writing such delinquent or his representative or representatives, demanding that a return of his property be made within 20 days from the date of such notice. The notice provided for herein may be given personally or by sending the delinquent through the post office a prepaid letter addressed to such delinquent or his representative or representatives at his address as the same appears on his records of said clerk or other officer, or at his most notorious place of abode. Such notice shall be deemed to be given at the time it is posted

<page id="GA1959.2.P1010" no="GA1959.2.3010" />

and the certificate of said clerk or other officer shall be sufficient evidence thereof. The notice shall recite the fact of delinquency and the date upon which the return should be made by such delinquent and that the return should be filed with said clerk or other officer.</p><p>(c) If the owner of such property fails or refuses to return his property or any part thereof, or fails or refuses to return his property or any part thereof at a proper valuation for the years for which it is or should be made after the notice authorized in subdivision (b) of this Section is given, it shall be the duty of said clerk or other officer to prepare an itemized list of the property, real and personal, of such delinquent, subject to taxation by said City of Senoia, and to file the same within 10 days (exclusive of Sundays and public holidays) from the date of closing the books, with the tax assessors of said city. The tax assessors shall assess the property so returned by said clerk or other officer, together with such other taxable property of such delinquent, real and personal, as they may ascertain is omitted from such return for the years in default. When said tax assessors have made their assessment, they shall give written notice thereof to the delinquent, and said assessment shall be final and conclusive upon said delinquent unless said delinquent shall, within 20 days from the date of receipt of such written notice raise the question that the assessment is excessive, in which event the question of valuation shall be referred to arbitrators, one to be chosen by the delinquent, one by the assessors, with the power to choose an umpire in the case of disagreement, and their word shall be final, irrevocable and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation or partial revocation of a submission or award thereon. If said delinquent shall refuse or neglect to designate an arbitrator within three days after the expiration of said twenty days' notice, the arbitrator appointed by said tax assessors is hereby required to appoint an arbitrator for said delinquent, and said arbitrators shall thereupon proceed to hear and determine the question in issue, with like authority to choose an umpire in case of disagreement.</p>

<page id="GA1959.2.P1011" no="GA1959.2.3011" />

<p>(d) If the delinquent disputes the taxability of his property, or of any part thereof, he may raise the question by bill in equity addressed to the Superior Court of Coweta County, Georgia.</p><p>(e) The method hereinbefore authorized is intended to be cumulative and is in addition to every other remedy now or hereafter existing, at law or in equity, and the use of others shall not in anywise deprive said City of Senoia from the use of the foregoing remedy.</p><p>(f) The mayor and council of said city are hereby fully empowered and authorized to make and adopt any and all regulations, rules and ordinances not inconsistent with the laws of the State of Georgia and of this charter, necessary, requisite or convenient in the exercise and enforcement of the levy and collection of its ad valorem taxes.</p></blockquote></p><p>Section 2. Said Act as amended is hereby further amended by striking from section 28 the sentence Said mayor and council shall have authority to prescribe by ordinance for assessing the value of all property, both real and personal, not returned for taxation, and for double taxing all defaulters., so that when so amended section 28 shall read:</p><p><blockquote><p>Section 28. The mayor and council shall, at their first regular meeting in each year, elect three upright, intelligent and discreet persons, who shall be citizens and qualified voters of said city and owners of real estate therein, as city tax-assessors. Said assessors may be removed from office at any time for sufficient cause to be judged of by the mayor and council. It shall be the duty of said assessors to assess the value of all real estate in said city for the purpose of taxation by said city, and said mayor and council shall have authority to provide rules for their government. The city tax-assessors shall make return of the assessments made by them to the mayor and council thirty days before the time for collecting taxes. When said return is made said assessors shall fix a time for hearing objections to their assessment

<page id="GA1959.2.P1012" no="GA1959.2.3012" />

and the clerk of said city shall give each owner of property whose tax return has been increased at least fifteen days' notice of such meeting, stating therein the amount of such increase. If the property has been given in by an agent, notice to the agent shall be sufficient. If the owner is not a resident of the city, and has no known agent residing therein, the mayor and council shall have authority to prescribe by ordinance what notice, if any, shall be given. The city tax-assessors shall receive such compensation as the mayor and council shall allow, and no more. <sidenote>Tax assessors.</sidenote></p></blockquote></p><p>Section 3.
