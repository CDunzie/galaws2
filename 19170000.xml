Upon the filing of a petition, as provided in this Act, the clerk shall at once notify the judge, who shall refer the cause to one of the general examiners or to a special examiner. It shall thereupon become the duty of such examiner to make up a preliminary report containing an abstract of the title to the land form public records and all other evidences of a trustworthy nature that can reasonably be obtained by him, which said abstract shall contain full enough extracts from the records, and other matters referred to therein, to enable the court to decide the questions involved; also a statement of the facts relating to the possession of the lands; also containing the names and addresses, so far as he is able to ascertain, of all persons interested in the land, as well as all adjoining owners, showing their several apparent or possible interests, and indicating upon whom and in what manner process should be served or notices given, in accordance with the provisions of this Act.

However, nothing herein shall be construed to require the giving of additional notice by publication, otherwise than in this Act provided for, to non-residents or persons who, by reason of absence from the State, or by reason of their whereabouts being unknown, cannot be found and served with process. <sidenote>Additional notices.</sidenote></p><p>SEC. 18. Any person, whether notified or not, may become a party to the proceeding for the purpose of filing objections to the granting of the relief prayed for in the petition, or any part thereof, by filing in court an answer, showing that he claims some interest in the premises, and the grounds of his objection; or he may file a cross-action praying that the title to the land, or some interest therein, be decreed to be in him, and registered accordingly. <sidenote>Objections and cross-action.</sidenote></p><p>SEC. 19.

He shall give notice of the time and place of hearing to the petitioner and to such persons as shall have filed any pleading in the case. <sidenote>Hearing and report.</sidenote> <sidenote>Notice.</sidenote></p><p>SEC. 20.

of the attendance of witnesses, the production of books and papers, and of adjournment and recessing to hear all lawful evidences submitted. In addition thereto he is empowered to make such independent examination of the title as he may deem necessary. Upon his request the clerk shall issue commission for the taking of testimony of such witnesses as, under the provisions of law on that subject, may have their testimony taken by interrogatories in ordinary actions. He shall also have the powers of a commissioner appointed by the Superior Court under sections 5910 to 5917, inclusive, of the Civil Code of 1910. Within fifteen days after such hearing shall have been concluded the examiner, unless for good cause the time shall be extended by the judge, shall file with the clerk a report of his conclusions of law and of fact, setting forth the state of the title, any liens or encumbrances thereon, by whom held, the amounts due thereon, together with the abstract of title to said land, and any other information affecting its validity, and a brief or a stenographic report of the evidence taken by him. He shall mail to each of the parties who have appeared in the cause notice of the filing of his report. Any of the parties to the proceeding may, within twenty days after such report is filed, file exceptions to the conclusions of law or of fact or to the general findings of the examiner. The clerk shall thereupon notify the judge that the record is ready for his determination. If the petitioner, or any contestant of petitioner's right, shall demand a trial by jury upon any issue of fact arising upon exceptions to the examiner's report, the court shall cause the same to be referred to a jury, either at the term of court which may then be in session or at the next term of the court, or at any succeeding term of the court, to which the case may be continued for good and lawful reasons; but it shall be the duty of the judge to expedite the hearing of the case, and not to continue it unless for good cause shown, or upon the consent of all parties at interest. The issue or issues of fact shall be tried before the jury, in the event jury trial is requested, upon the evidence reported by the examiner, except in cases where, under the provisions

<page id="GA1917.1.P115" no="GA1917.1.118" />

of law in this State, evidence other than that reported by the auditor may be submitted to the jury on exceptions to an auditor's report; and except, further, that in the case the examiner has reported to the court findings of fact based on his personal examination, either party may introduce additional testimony as to such facts, provided that he will make it appear, under oath, that he has not been fully heard and given full opportunity to present testimony on the same matter before the examiner. The verdict of the jury upon the questions of fact shall operate to the same extent as it would in the case of exceptions to an auditor's report in an ordinary case in equity. In all matters not otherwise provided for, the procedure upon the examiner's report and the exceptions thereto shall be in accordance with procedure prevailing in this State as to auditor's reports in equity and exceptions thereto. The right to grant a new trial upon any issue submitted to a jury, and right of exception to the Supreme Court, are prescribed. The judge may rerefer or recommit the record to the examiner in like manner as auditor's reports may be recommitted in any equity cause; or he may, on his own motion, recommit it to the same or any other examiner for further information and report. <sidenote>Powers of examiner as auditor or master and as commissioner.</sidenote> <sidenote>Report.</sidenote> <sidenote>Evidence.</sidenote> <sidenote>Notice.</sidenote> <sidenote>Exceptions.</sidenote> <sidenote>Jury trial.</sidenote> <sidenote>Continuance.</sidenote> <sidenote>Evidence at trial.</sidenote> <sidenote>Verdict, effect of.</sidenote> <sidenote>Procedure.</sidenote> <sidenote>New trials.</sidenote> <sidenote>Recommitted.</sidenote></p><p>SEC. 21.

While the cause is pending before the examiner of titles, or at any time before final decree, the judge, or the examiner with the approval of the judge, may require the land to be surveyed by some competent surveyor, and may order durable bounds to be set and a plat thereof to be filed among the papers of the suit. But before such survey is made all adjoining land owners shall be given at least five days' notice. The petitioner, or any adjoining owner, dissatisfied with the survey, may file a protest with the court within ten days from the time the plat is filed; and thereupon an issue shall be made up and tried as in case of protest to the return of land processioners. <sidenote>Survey of land.</sidenote> <sidenote>Notice.</sidenote> <sidenote>Protest.</sidenote></p>

<p>SEC. 23. If in any case the petitioner so desires, or if the court is of opinion that the petitioner's title is not and cannot be made proper for registration, the petition may, with leave of the court, be dismissed without prejudice, on terms to be determined by the court. <sidenote>Dismissal.</sidenote></p><p>SEC. 24. Amendments to petitions or other pleadings, or the severance thereof, including joinder, substitution, or discontinuance of parties, and the omission or severance of any portion or parcel of the land, may be ordered or allowed by the court, at any time before final decree, upon terms that may be just and reasonable; and the court may require facts to be stated in the petition in addition to those prescribed by this Act. The examiner shall have these powers, subject to review by exception to his reports. <sidenote>Amendments, parties, etc.</sidenote></p><p>SEC. 25. The land described in any petition may be dealt with, pending registration, as if no such petition had been filed; but any person who shall acquire any interest in or claim against any such land shall at once appear as a petitioner, or answer as a party defendant, in the pleadings for registration, and such interest or claim shall be subject to the decree of the court. <sidenote>Dealings pending registration</sidenote></p><p>SEC. 26. After the record shall have been perfected and settled, the judge of the superior court shall thereupon proceed to decide the cause; and if, upon consideration of such record, the title be found in the petitioner, the judge shall enter a decree to that effect, ascertaining all limitations, liens, encumbrances, etc., and declaring the land entitled to registration accordingly as he shall find, and such decree shall be entered upon the minutes of the superior court and become a part of the records thereof. If, upon consideration of the record, he finds that the petitioner is not entitled to a decree declaring the land entitled to registration, he shall enter judgment and decree accordingly. If any person shall have filed a cross-action praying for the registration of the title to be found in him, the judge may enter a decree to that effect, in like manner ascertaining and declaring all limitations, liens, etc., and declaring the land entitled to registration accordingly. If separate parcels

are involved, the court shall render separate decree as to each parcel; and the same shall be done where the petitioner has divided a tract into separately described parcels and has accurately described each parcel for separate registration. <sidenote>Decree of registration.</sidenote> <sidenote>Separate decree.</sidenote></p><p>SEC. 27.

It shall not be an exception to such conclusiveness that the person is an infant, lunatic, or is under any disability, but said person may, in the manner provided, have recourse upon the indemnity fund hereinafter provided for, for any loss he may suffer by reason of being so concluded. <sidenote>Decree concludes all persons.</sidenote></p><p>SEC. 28. The county commissioner, or other officer having charge of the county business, of each county shall provide for the clerk of the superior court in said county a book in which he shall enroll and register and index all decrees of title, to be known as the Register of Decrees of Title; also a book to be prepared, printed, and ruled in substantially the manner hereinafter provided, to be called the Title Register, in which said clerk shall enroll, register, and index, as herein provided, the certificate of title herein provided for, and all subsequent transfers of title, and note all voluntary or involuntary transactions in any wise affecting the title to said land, authorized to be entered thereon; and they shall from time to time furnish such additional books as may be necessary. Upon the registration of such decree and certificate of title the clerk shall issue an owner's certificate of title, under the seal of his office, which shall be delivered to the owner, or his duly authorized agent or attorney. <sidenote>Register of decrees.</sidenote> <sidenote>Title register.</sidenote> <sidenote>Certificate to owner.</sidenote></p><p>SEC. 29.

Whenever the whole of any registered estate is transferred or conveyed, the same may be done by a transfer or conveyance upon, or attached to, the owner's certificate of title, substantially in the form herein, provided for. The same shall be signed and acknowledged or attested as if it were a deed to land, and shall have the full force and effect of a deed. Provided, that if the said sale or transfer be in trust, upon condition, with power to sell, or other unusual form of conveyance, the same shall be set out in said transfer, and shall be entered upon the Registration of Titles book as hereinafter provided. Upon presentation of the said transfer, together with the owner's certificate of title, to the clerk, it shall be duly noted and registered in the Title Register, in accordance with the provisions of this Act, and the certficate of title on the Title Register and the owner's certificate of title so presented shall be canceled, and a new certificate of title in the name of the transferee shall be registered on the Title Register, and a new owner's certificate of title shall be issued to the transferee, which new certificate shall refer to the former certificates just canceled. <sidenote>Transfer of registered estate.</sidenote> <sidenote>Noted on register.</sidenote></p><p>SEC. 31. Whenever a part of any registered land is transferred or conveyed, the same shall be by form substantially as in case of a total transfer, but setting forth, particularly and specifically, the portion of the land transferred, if it be an undivided interest, or if it be a particular portion of the tract, describing the same accurately and definitely. In case an undivided interest is transferred, upon presentation of such transfer, together with the owner's certificate of title, the clerk shall not cancel the owner's certificate so presented nor the certificate of title on the Title Rgister, but shall enter a notation of such partial transfer on the certificate of title, on the Title Register, and on the owner's certificate; and said clerk shall also register upon the Title Register a certificate of title in the name of the grantee of the undivided portion of said

estate so transferred, and issue to him an owner's certificate correspondingly, setting out the part or amount of land transferred, as the case may be. If the transfer be of a divided part of the land, the clerk shall first enter the fact of the transfer upon the certificate of title on the Title Register, and shall cancel the certificate of title on the Title Register and the owner's certificate of title. Thereupon he shall register new certificates of title on the Title Register, separately, the one in the name of the transferee for the portion of the tract conveyed to him, and the other to the transferor for the portion retained; and the clerk shall also issue new separate owner's certificate accordingly. The said clerk shall note upon the Title Register and the owner's certificate the reference and cross-reference to the certificates herein referred to. <sidenote>Part transfer.</sidenote> <sidenote>Undivided interest.</sidenote> <sidenote>Entries on register, etc.</sidenote></p><p>SEC. 32. Whenever the owner of any registered land shall desire to convey the same as security for debt, with power of sale without foreclosure, it may be done by a short form of transfer, substantially in the form hereinafter set forth. The same shall be signed and properly acknowledged or attested as if it were a deed to land, and shall be presented, together with the owner's certificate, to the clerk, whose duty it shall be to note upon the owner's certificate and on the certificate of title in the Title Register the name of the creditor, the amount of debt, and the date of maturity of same, and showing that a creditor's certificate has been issued therefor; and when only a part of the registered estate shall be so conveyed, the clerk shall note upon the said book and owner's certificate the part so conveyed. The clerk shall retain, number, and file away the instrument of transfer, and shall issue and deliver to the creditor what shall be known as a creditor's certificate, over his hand and seal, setting out the portion so conveyed. All registered encumbrances, rights, or adverse claims affecting the estate represented thereby, in existence at the time the creditor's certificate is issued, shall be noted thereon. <sidenote>Conveyance to secure debt.</sidenote> <sidenote>Entries.</sidenote></p><p>SEC. 33. The creditor's certificate shall be assignable or negotiable to the same extent as the note or other evidence

of indebtedness secured thereby may be, but assignments or transfers of the creditor's certificate need not be noted on the Title Register. A transfer or assignment of the indebtedness shall operate to transfer the creditor's certificate securing the same, in like manner and to the same extent as is set forth in section 4276 of the Civil Code, relating to the case of transfer of indebtedness secured by mortgage, unless otherwise agreed between the parties. The creditor's certificate may be surrendered and canceled at any time by the owner thereof. It shall be the creditor's duty to surrender the same and give order for cancellation of the same when the debt is paid. If he refuses to do so he may be compelled by the court to do so, and in any proper case the judge may order a cancellation on the Title Register. Upon presentation of an order of cancellation, with the surrendered creditor's certificate, or upon presentation of the judge's order directing cancellation, the clerk shall enter a notation of the same in the Register of Titles and on the owner's certificate of title. <sidenote>Assignment of certificate.</sidenote> <sidenote>Surrender and cancellation.</sidenote></p><p>SEC. 35. If the debt secured by the creditor's certificate so issued, or any part thereof, shall be due and unpaid, the holder of said creditor's certificate may, after advertising the property for sale in the manner prescribed by law for advertising sheriff's sales of land, expose the same at auction before the court-house door of the county, and sell the same to the highest and best bidder for cash. The sale need not be conducted by the creditor or holder of the creditor's certificate personally, but may be conducted through any agent or attorney. The holder of said certificate, his agent for attorney, shall thereupon make oath to the facts, and apply to the judge for an order of transfer to the purchaser. The application shall be accompanied by a certified copy of the certificate of title from the Title Register as of the date of the sale. The judge shall cause at least five days' notice to be given to the debtor and to any person who, according to the Title Register, shall have acquired any interest in the property subsequently to the issuance of the creditor's certificate; and if no objections are made (or after hearing, if objections be made) the

judge shall grant an order of transfer, with such directions for cancellation of other certificates and entries, and otherwise as shall be in accordance with the justice of the case and with the spirit of this Act. The proceeds of the sale shall be applied first to the payment of the costs of advertising the sale and obtaining the judge's order of transfer, then to the payment of the debt, and the remainder, if any, shall be paid to the debtor, or his order. <sidenote>Sale to pay debt.</sidenote> <sidenote>Transfer to purchaser.</sidenote> <sidenote>Notice.</sidenote> <sidenote>Objections.</sidenote> <sidenote>Application of proceeds of sale.</sidenote></p><p>SEC. 36. Nothing herein shall prevent the owner from transferring his registered title as security for debt, or from causing the title to be registered in the name of the creditor by transferring to the creditor as if he were an ordinary vendee of the registered title; and if bond for title or bond to reconvey be given, the same may be noted on the certificate of title on the Title Register and on the owner's certificate, provided the same be attested or acknowledged as if it were a deed. <sidenote>Transfer to secure debt.</sidenote></p><p>SEC. 37.

Wherever a transfer, or transfer as security for debt, or mortgage, as to an estate in registered land, is executed in the form prescribed in this Act and the same duly registered and noted in the register of titles, and the same contains nothing more than the filling in of the blanks in said forms prescribed, so that the entry of registration on the Title Register, construed in connection with the prescribed form, shows the full transaction, it shall not be necessary to record the transfer, security transfer, or mortgage, otherwise than by the registration in the Title Register; and such registration shall, for all purposes, take the place of recordation as to such instruments so executed; and a certified copy of such registration shall be admissible in evidence on like terms and with like effect as a certified copy of a deed, mortgage, or other similar instrument is admissible under existing laws. In such cases the original

instrument of transfer (together with the canceled owner's certificate), or original instrument of transfer as security for debt, or original mortgage, as the case may be, shall be numbered with the registration number of the title to which it relates, and carefully filed away in such manner as to be of easy access, and preserved as a part of the records of the office of the clerk of the superior court. In case of a mortgage so executed the clerk shall, on request, make a certified copy and deliver to the mortgagee, and such certified copy shall stand for all purposes in lieu of the original, and shall be original evidence to the same extent that an original mortgage ordinarily is, in any court. If the instrument of transfer be not in the short form herein prescribed, or if it contains any provisions not provided for in said form, or if it is executed for the purpose of transferring any estate or interest in the registered land in trust, or upon any condition, or upon any peculiar, unusual limitation, the details at variance with or additional to those provided for under the prescribed form need not be entered in full on the Title Register and the owner's certificate, but the clerk shall record such instrument in full on the deed book of the county, in like manner as deeds to unregistered land are recorded, and shall, after the general entry of the transfer on the Title Register and on the owner's certificate, add thereto a notation that the same is in trust, upon condition, or on special terms, as the case may be, followed by the words See deed book (or mortgage book, as the case may be)...... page...... Like procedure shall be followed in case of a transfer to secure debt or a mortgage not following the form herein prescribed, but in such cases the clerk shall not retain the original instrument, but shall return the same to the creditor after it shall have been registered and recorded. <sidenote>Record other than registration, when not required.</sidenote> <sidenote>Certified copy as evidence.</sidenote> <sidenote>Filing of instrument.</sidenote> <sidenote>Record and reference thereto.</sidenote></p><p>SEC. 39.

Upon the grant of letters of administration or executorship by the court of ordinary and upon presentation of a certified copy of the same to the clerk of the superior court and the presentation of the owner's certificate, the clerk shall make a special entry on the certificate of title on the Title Register, showing the presentation of the letters of administration or executorship, the name of the representative, the court and county of his appointment, and the date of the letters and of the transfer of the title to the representative. The clerk shall thereupon cancel the certificate of title and the owner's certificate outstanding in the name of the decedent, and issue to the administrator or the executor, as the case may be, a new owner's certificate. In the event the decedent was the owner of only a fractional undivided interest in the title and the outstanding certificate stood in the name of the decedent and others, or where from any other cause the decedent was not the sole owner of the certificate, the outstanding certificates shall nevertheless be canceled, and a new certificate registerd and new owner's certificate issued with the name of the personal representative substituted for the name of the decedent. <sidenote>Letters of administration, etc.</sidenote> <sidenote>Cancellation, and new certificate.</sidenote></p><p>SEC 45. In case the owner of registered land die intestate, and there is no administration upon the estate within twelve months from the date of his death, or in the event administration terminates without the land being disposed of, the heirs at law of such intestate, or any one or more of the persons who claim to be heirs at law of such intestate, may petition the superior court of the county to have their title by descent declared as to such registered land. In such application there shall be set forth the names of all persons who are alleged to be the heirs at law; and if all are not joined, process or notice shall be served, as in cases in equity, upon all not so joined. The petition shall be verified by the affidavit of one of the petitioners, shall set forth in detail the name and address, as last known, of the decedent, a statement as to whether he was married or single, or a widower; if married more than once, the names of all of his wives; the names of all children and descendants

of children, if any, showing in detail whether the parents of such children are living or dead, and showing in detail how and wherein the persons who are alleged to be the heirs at law are in fact the heirs at law of such decedent under the rules of inheritance in this State. It shall also give the date of the death of the decedent and set forth that he died leaving no will, and that, in the judgment of the applicant, there is no need for administration upon the estate. Upon such application being filed the judge shall thereupon grant an order setting the application down to be heard at the court-house in the county where the land lies, on some day not less than thirty days from the date of the application, and calling on all persons to show cause before the court on that day why the persons named as heirs at law in the application should not be so declared to be by the judgment and decree of the court. A copy of the application and the order of the court thereon shall be published in the newspaper in which the sheriff's sales of the county are advertised in like manner as sheriff's sales are advertised. Upon the day named, unless the matter be continued by order or orders of the judge to some future time, the court shall proceed to hear and determine the question, together with all objections, if any, which may be filed, and to adjudge and decree that the alleged decedent is dead and that there is no administration on his estate, and that he left no will, and who are his heirs at law; unless it appears that the alleged decedent is not dead, or that there is administration upon his estate, or that an application for administration is pending, or that the decedent left a will, in either of which events the petition shall be dismissed. Upon granting an order of heirship the court shall thereupon order a transfer of the registered title from the decedent to the heirs at law to be registered; and upon production of the owner's certificate of the decedent, and the judge's order for a transfer, the clerk shall register the transfer and cancel the certificate registered in the name of the decedent and the owner's certificate, and issue a new owner's certificate in the name of the persons declared to be the heirs at law. In such an application, if the alleged heirs at law be of full age and under

no disabilities, and the same shall so appear to the court, and it shall further appear that they have voluntarily partitioned the land in kind among themselves, the court may, in connection with the order of transfer, direct that the certificate standing in the name of the decedent be canceled and that new certificates shall be registered and issued to each of the heirs for the particular parcel of land coming to each under the voluntary partition set forth in the application. If the decedent shall have left a widow, the application shall disclose whether the widow has elected to take dower or to become an heir of the estate, and she shall be a party to the proceedings, and the court shall specifically provide what interest or estate she shall take under the decree of heirship, and, except where in the decree the land is partitioned into separate tracts, the court shall, in the decree of heirship and in the order of transfer, specifically set forth (except in the case of sole heir), what undivided interest each heir shall take. In case the decedent be a female, the procedure shall be similar, except in so far as the difference between the rights of the husband and wife upon the death of his spouse shall make changes necessary. Where the wife claims to be entitled to take possession of the estate without administration, under the provisions of subsection 1 of section 3931 of the Code, the procedure shall be substantially in the same manner. <sidenote>Heirs' title registry of</sidenote> <sidenote>Procedure on application.</sidenote> <sidenote>Publication.</sidenote> <sidenote>Transfer of registered title.</sidenote> <sidenote>Cancellation, and new certificates.</sidenote> <sidenote>Widow.</sidenote> <sidenote>Interests specified.</sidenote></p><p>SEC. 46.

<p>SEC. 47. Wherever an administrator shall have been appointed and shall have caused registered land to be transferred into his name, and he stands ready to be discharged, and it is not necessary to sell such registered land for the purposes of administration and it should properly go to the heirs at law of the decedent, he may institute a proceeding substantially similar to that prescribed in section forty-five of this Act, for the ascertainment of the heirs at law and for an order directing the transfer of such estate from him to such heirs at law when so ascertained. In case any other trustee shall hold title, where the beneficiaries of the trust are not definitely and particularly disclosed, and it becomes appropriate that they should be definitely ascertained, such trustee may in like manner petition the court, upon showing that the trust has become executed, for a decree settling and ascertaining who the beneficiaries are, and directing a transfer to such beneficiaries. <sidenote>Administrator's transfer to heirs.</sidenote></p><p>SEC. 48.

Production of the certified copy of the decree shall not be required when it is rendered in the same court as that in which the title is registered, but the clerk shall act upon the judge's order of transfer and the inspection of his own minute book. <sidenote>Transfer by clerk, how made.</sidenote></p>

<p>SEC. 50. Wherever in any other case it is desired to have an involuntary transfer entered of record, application therefor shall be made to the judge of the court. The judge may hear the facts or, if he deems best, he may refer the application to an examiner of titles to make up and report the facts. He shall see to it that all parties at interest are given reasonable notice before any order of transfer is made. Wherever, in his judgment, the interests of justice so require, he shall, before granting such order, cause notice of the application to be published in the newspaper in which the sheriff's sales of the county are advertised for not less than four insertions in separate weeks. Before granting such order directing the transfer, he shall fully satisfy himself that all parties who have or may have an interest in the matter of the transfer have been notified, and, in the case of minors or other persons under disability, that guardians ad litem have been appointed to represent their interests, and that there is no valid reason why the order directing involuntary transfer should not be made, and thereupon he shall enter a decree or judgment upon the minutes of the court, reciting the facts and that an order of transfer has been issued, and shall issue the order of transfer in substantially the form and manner herein prescribed. <sidenote>Involuntary transfer.</sidenote></p><p>SEC. 51.

If a court having jurisdiction of the case, upon such proceeding, shall find that any transfer or other dealing with registered land shall have been made for the purpose of hindering, delaying, or defrauding creditors and that the rights of no innocent parties will be prejudiced by the court's judgment or decree, it shall be within the power of said court to pass such judgment or decree as will avoid such transfer or the effect of such other transaction as may have been made to hinder, delay, or defraud creditors; and upon the decree or judgment of such court the judge of the superior court of the county where the land lies, upon application as hereinbefore provided, shall have the authority and power to direct such cancellations and transfers to be entered upon the Title Register and upon the owner's certificate as shall be necessary to carry the same into effect. <sidenote>Transfers to defeat creditors; attack and procedure.</sidenote></p><p>SEC. 56.

Until and unless such notation is made, such delinquent tax or assessment

Provided, that the court may in any case order additional notice to be given, either by publication or otherwise, before directing the issuance of a duplicate certificate; and provided, further, that in case the application is made by personal representative of a deceased person, claiming that the certificate was lost or destroyed while in the possession of the decedent, the notice of the petition shall be published once a week for eight successive weeks, instead of four, as required in other cases. <sidenote>Duplicate of lost certificate.</sidenote></p><p>SEC. 59. The clerk of the superior court is charged with the primary duty of determining whether any instrument, writing or record, or other matter is in proper shape for registration, and with the duty of correctly and legally making the registration, including all formal incidents thereto, and shall be liable to any injured person for any failure of duty in this respect. All registrations of title and all entries and notations made by him upon the Title Register, of transfers or of the cancellation or discharge of liens or encumbrances, shall be prima facie conclusive; and unless a caveat be filed, as provided for in this Act, seeking to set aside, modify, or otherwise affect such entry,

In the event application is made to a clerk to have any transfer or other transaction registerel or noted, and he shall be in doubt as to whether the same should be registered, entered, or noted, or shall be in doubt in regard to any detail thereof, either the clerk or any party at interest may petition the judge of the court for direction; and such judge, after it shall have appeared that the parties at interest have had reasonable notice, may proceed to hear the matter and to give directions and instructions to the clerk, whose duty it shall be to follow the directions and instructions of the court.

Thereupon the clerk shall note upon the Register of Titles the fact that caveat has been filed, and by whom, and to what entry, notation, or act of registration it applies. Thereupon the matter shall be presented to the judge, who shall order all persons at interest to show cause on a day named why the relief prayed for in the caveat should not be granted; and upon proof being made that due notice has been given to all parties at interest, the judge shall proceed to hear the matter

and shall render a judgment of the court, giving direction to the matter, and may thereupon require such entry, registration, or notation to be canceled or modified, and may require the outstanding certificate of title and owner's certificate to be modified accordingly. To that end the court may require the outstanding owner's certificate of title to be brought into court by subp[oelig]na duces tecum, or other process, including attachment for contempt, and if the court finds that production of the certificate can not be compelled, then he shall provide for publication of notice of the court's action thereon for a period of time not less than once a week for four weeks in the paper in which the sheriff's sales of the county are advertised, the expense of making the publication to be provided for in such manner as the court shall order. <sidenote>Caveat to entry, etc.</sidenote> <sidenote>Judgment thereon.</sidenote></p><p>SEC. 61.

In case the notation is for the purpose of protecting the lien of a judgment, the persons making the application for the notation shall produce and exhibit to the clerk the execution or a certified copy of the judgment, except in cases where the judgment is rendered in the superior court of the same county where the registration is made, in which event production of the execution or certified copy of the judgment shall not be required, but the clerk may act upon inspection of the original judgment on the minutes of his own court. <sidenote>Procedure to obtain notation.</sidenote></p><p>SEC. 62.

should be the words, Registered Title No..... The first decree entered is numbered, Registered Title No. 1, the second, Registered Title No. 2, and so on in continuous, consecutive order. The registered title number of a registered tract never changes, though any number of subsequent certificates may be issued thereon; therefore the registered title number and the certificate number will usually be different.</p><p>Even though several separate tracts may be joined in the same application, the judge should render separate decrees as to each tract; and these decrees should be separately entered and given separate registered title numbers. Every certificate of title and every owner's crtificate and creditor's certificate must carry on it (in addition to its own certificate number) the registered title number of the decree under which the tract to which it pertains was registered.</p><p>A part of the register of decrees of title shall be an alphabetical index thereto, which the clerk shall carefully keep. Whenever a decree is entered on the register of decrees of title, the clerk shall immediately index the same in the name of the person in whose favor the title is registered, under proper alphabetical head; the name being followed by the registered title number.

<p>The two pages thus facing each other on the register constitute the original certificate of title, when the blanks are duly filled in and signed by the clerk. The first certificate of title in the book should be numbered Certificate No. 1, the next one Certificate No. 2, and so on, in continuous, consecutive order. If a new book be opened, the numbering therein should begin with the number next succeeding the last number in the book just completed.</p><p>In registering a certificate of title, in addition to the certificate number, the registered title number should also be inserted. The registered title number is always the same as that which appears on the decree of title, by virtue of which the land to which the certificate relates was originally registered. Therefore every certificate of title registered in the Title Register bears a different certificate number from every other certificate of title registered therein, but all certificates of title which refer to the same registered tract, no matter how many such certificates may be issued in the course of time, bear the same registered title number. <sidenote>Registered title number.</sidenote></p><p>The clerk shall keep an alphabetical index of the Title Register. This may most conveniently be kept in a separate book. Whenever a certificate of title is entered in the Title Register the clerk shall insert in the index, under proper alphabetical head, the name of the person in whose favor the certificate is registered, and the reference to the certificate number and the registered title number. Whenever a certificate is entered in the name of more than one person, the name of each shall be likewise alphabetically indexed. <sidenote>Index.</sidenote></p><p>SEC. 100. When registering a certificate of title upon a transfer the clerk shall bring forward and appropriately enter on the new certificate of title all entries and notations appearing on the certificate from which the transfer is made, except such as shall have been canceled.
