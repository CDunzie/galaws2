and man-power to the successful prosecution of this war; and, <sidenote>Preamble. State of war.</sidenote></p><p>Whereas, the State of Georgia, as one of the forty-eight commonwealths composing the Union, desires in every possible way to aid the National Government in the struggle in which it is engaged, and to utilize any and all of its resources to aid in winning the war; and, <sidenote>Aid of war.</sidenote></p><p>Whereas, the conduct of the war on the battlefields of Europe, with the consequent necessity of transporting troops and supplies from the Atlantic seaboard, has created an enormous demand for shipping, and has imposed a heavy burden upon Atlantic seaboard ports and terminals, and has necessitated an extension and enlargement of terminal and port facilities; and, <sidenote>Shipping and ports.</sidenote></p><p>Whereas, the handling of troops, and of supplies for these troops and for the Allies of the United States, has further imposed a great burden upon the transportation systems of the country, particularly upon those connecting the Atlantic seaboard with the interior; and <sidenote>Transportation.</sidenote></p><p>Whereas, during the winter of 1917, for many days the Atlantic harbors of Hampton Roads, as well as harbors north of that point, were frozen up, so as to render it difficult, if not impossible, to handle and load the shipping available for transporting troops and supplies to Europe; and a repetition of such conditions might be a serious handicap in the successful conduct of the war; and this condition has demonstrated the necessity for the development of warm water ports along the Atlantic seaboard, where freezing conditions are unknown; and <sidenote>Frozen harbors.</sidenote></p><p>Whereas, the supplying of coal for the navies of the United States and its allies for the shipping now in existence and being constructed by the United States and its allies and for the manufacturing enterprises engaged in war industries and located in the Eastern section of the United States has become a serious and vital question; has necessitated the most rigid rules for the distribution of coal,

<page id="GA1918.1.P214" no="GA1918.1.217" />

and a curtailment of legitimate enterprise and business, because of the inability to supply the coal needed for their purposes; and has resulted in the establishment of a restricted area in the northeastern section of the United States, within which area no new industries are now permitted to be established, except on condition that the establishment of such industries within such area shall not create an additional demand for coal; and <sidenote>Coal.</sidenote></p><p>Whereas, the shortage in coal is due to the lack of adequate transportation facilities from the coal mines to the seaboard, as well as to the fact that the mining and production of coal is not being carried on to the extent necessary for the country's requirements; and <sidenote>Coal shortage.</sidenote></p><p>Whereas, the remedy for this condition obviously consists in the further development of the coal resources of the country; in the mining and production of additional tonnage, both from the developed fields and from any new fields that are or may be made accessible to Atlantic seaboard points; and in the furnishing of additional transportation facilities by which such coal can be quickly and easily delivered at accessible ports; and <sidenote>Remedy.</sidenote></p><p>Whereas, there exist in Alabama large deposits of coal accessible to the Black Warrior River, which can be cheaply barged down the Black Warrior and Mobile Rivers (already largely canalized) to Mobile Bay on the Gulf of Mexico; and there further exists in southern Illinois (tributary to the Mississippi River) large veins of coal suitable for bunker purposes, which can be likewise barged down the Mississippi River to the Gulf of Mexico; and there exists in western Kentucky (tributary to the Mississippi River) large supplies of an inferior coal not suitable for bunker purposes, but available for domestic and manufacturing purposes in the Mississippi Valley, so as to relieve the demand for coal which is suitable for bunker purposes and for export; and <sidenote>Coal deposits.</sidenote></p><p>Whereas, this Alabama coal, and coal from southern Illinois, which can be and is readily delivered at the Gulf of Mexico, would greatly relieve the existing shortage in

<page id="GA1918.1.P215" no="GA1918.1.218" />

coal, if the barge transportation of the said coal could be continuously maintained, without trans-shipment to an Atlantic port; and <sidenote>Relief of shortage.</sidenote></p><p>Whereas, there is in existence along the northern edge of the Gulf of Mexico a natural inland waterway from the Mississippi River through Lake Ponchartrain and Lake Borgne, thence eastwardly past Mobile Bay to St. Marks, Florida, on Apalachee Bay, almost south of Tallahassee, Florida; which inland waterway can be opened up and completed, so as to be available for barge transportation, at small cost, and within a short period of time; and <sidenote>Inland waterway.</sidenote></p><p>Whereas, there exists in southeastern Georgia a highland swamp (or a succession of fresh water lakes) located at an average height of 120 feet above mean low tide, embracing some six hundred and twenty-five (625) square miles, which swamp is drained by two rivers, one the St. Mary's, emptying into Cumberland Sound and the Atlantic Ocean, and the other the Suwanee, emptying into the Gulf of Mexico; the St. Mary's River being navigable for vessels drawing fifteen feet of water for sixty-one miles above the point where it empties into Cumberland Sound; and the Suwanee River being navigable for vessels drawing ten feet of water for a distance of approximately fifty miles in a generally east and west direction; and the water in the swamp being sufficient, or capable of being made sufficient, to supply the requirements of a lock-barge canal, connecting the Atlantic Ocean with the Gulf of Mexico; and <sidenote>Lakes in Georgia.</sidenote></p><p>Whereas, the chief of engineers of the United States army has heretofore surveyed and reported on the feasibility of a canal, with a bottom width of one hundred feet and capable of carrying barges drawing eight feet of water; and said canal starting at Cumberland Sound, on the Atlantic seaboard, running thence up the St. Mary's River sixty-one miles; thence from St. Mary's across the Okefenokee swamp by canals and locks to the Suwanee River, a distance of forty-five miles; thence down the Suwanee River in a generally westerly direction, a distance of fifty miles to Charles

<page id="GA1918.1.P216" no="GA1918.1.219" />

Ferry; thence from Charles by canal, a distance of seventy miles to St. Marks, on the Gulf coast, on the southeastern edge of Florida, just south of Tallahassee, where the Gulf of Mexico is deeper than it is further eastward at the mouth of the Suwanee; and from which point the inland waterway, above described, is available, or can be made available, westwardly to the mouth of the Mississippi River; and <sidenote>Survey.</sidenote></p><p>Whereas, according to the reports of the chief of engineers, made about 1880, the said canal would be two hundred and twenty-six miles in length; but by the utilization of the St. Mary's and Suwanee Rivers, of the Okefenokee swamp, and of other streams, the actual canal to be cut would be slightly over one hundred miles in length; the number of locks required would be approximately eight on the Atlantic side and six on the Gulf side, but said locks would not have to be built in flights; the character of the soil would permit a quick and cheap construction, being a sandy loam on the Atlantic side, a soft muck through the swamp, and sand and rotten limestone on the Gulf side; and the estimated cost of the canal (about 1880) would be only a little over eight million dollars for a lock-barge canal nine feet deep and one hundred feet wide at the bottom, less than the cost of a single track railroad from any of the available coal fields to tidewater; and <sidenote>Canal.</sidenote></p><p>Whereas, by the use of modern machinery (not available in 1880) the cost of constructing such canal would probably be greatly reduced; the time within which it could be constructed could be greatly lessened; and by the use of machinery, the man power required for its construction could be reduced to a minimum; and the equipment, organization and directing heads (who successfully constructed the Panama Canal), as well as the equipment, machinery and directing heads (who constructed the canal systems in Florida), could be utilized for its immediate construction; and <sidenote>Construction.</sidenote></p><p>Whereas, the construction of this canal and the completion of the inland waterway from St. Marks to the mouth of the Mississippi River would, in effect, extend the Mississippi

<page id="GA1918.1.P217" no="GA1918.1.220" />

River and the Mobile River to the Atlantic seaboard by a protected inland waterway for the purposes of barge transportation, thereby making possible the transportation by barges without trans-shipment to an Atlantic port of the mineral, agricultural, and manufactured products of the States tributary to the Gulf of Mexico and the Mississippi River, thereby relieving the railroad lines of an enormous burden of traffic of heavy and non-perishable products; thereby relieving the navy of the necessity of convoying large numbers of supply ships through the Gulf and around the peninsula of Florida; and thereby delivering, at a south Atlantic warm water port, coal and food supplies in large volume and at low cost, so that they could readily be delivered to their destination in Europe, or along the eastern coast of the United States; and <sidenote>Extention of rivers.</sidenote></p><p>Whereas, the terminus of said canal on the Atlantic seaboard would be the harbors of Cumberland Sound, Fernandina, Florida, and St. Mary's, Georgia, where the United States government has already spent over three and a half million dollars in building piers or breakwaters at the entrance to Cumberland Sound, but is now failing to utilize the benefits naturally derived from this expenditure; where there exists a land-locked warm water harbor of capacity sufficient to accommodate the entire navy and mercantile fleet of the United States; where the harbor is within less than five miles from the Atlantic ocean; where there already exists a depth of more than twenty-four feet over the bar, such depth being constantly increased by the tidal wash between the jetties already constructed, the tide rising five and nine-tenths feet; where any required depth can be easily and cheaply secured by the use of suction dredges, on account of the character of the bottom; where good anchorage can be obtained; where the United States government already owns some seven hundred and fifty and the State fifteen hundred acres of land fronting on the St. Mary's River and Cumberland Sound and ideally located for coal piers, dry docks, and repair facilities; and where there is available for wharfage purposes between fifty and one hundred

<page id="GA1918.1.P218" no="GA1918.1.221" />

miles of deep water front, which is practically now undeveloped; and where any depth that may be needed, including a thirty-foot channel to the sea, can be secured, and can be maintained at a minimum cost, because the deposits of silt by the St. Mary's River is probably as small as that of any river along the Atlantic seaboard; and <sidenote>Harbors, canal terminals, etc.</sidenote></p><p>Whereas, the building of the proposed canal and the development of the port of St. Mary's will establish a bunker coal port in warm water, easily accessible, without the necessity of pilotage or towage charges, on account of the ease of following the channel; to which a direct course can be laid from Europe, the British Isles, or the English Channel; and from which a direct course can be laid to the Straits of Florida for vessels destined for the Panama Canal; and <sidenote>Coal port.</sidenote></p><p>Whereas, the harbor at Cumberland Sound, when so developed into a coal port and repair point, will be the nearest Atlantic deep water port to the Panama Canal; will be immensely valuable as an aid to maintaining the mercantile marine of the United States after the war is over; and will be immensely valuable as a repair point for ships in distress, on account of its nearness to the ocean, its accessibility and the lack of necessity for pilotage fees; and <sidenote>Utility after war.</sidenote></p><p>Whereas, the development of the proposed canal and of the port of Cumberland Sound can be quickly, easily and cheaply completed, and will not only relieve or tend to relieve the situation as regards supplies of coal and food needed during the war, but will also have a continuing value after the war in the maintenance and upbuilding of the mercantile marine of the United States, and in the economic development of all that section of the country tributary to the Gulf of Mexico and to the Mississippi River; and <sidenote>Value of development.</sidenote></p><p>Whereas, in June, 1918, the Governor of Georgia, acting in his capacity as Governor and as chairman of the Georgia State Council of Defense, called a meeting of the Governors of fourteen other States, and of a number of men of

<page id="GA1918.1.P219" no="GA1918.1.222" />

standing, ability, and recognized patriotism, at St. Mary's, Georgia, to examine and consider the proposed project, and to take such action as they deemed wise, in order to call to the attention of the National Government the value and the possibilities of this proposed project, with the result that there was then organized the Mississippi, Gulf and Atlantic Canal Association, with the purpose in view of calling to the attention of the Federal authorities the advantages of its immediate construction as an emergency war measure: <sidenote>Governors in meeting.</sidenote></p><p>Now, therefore, be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Georgia, and is hereby enacted by the authority of the same,</p><p><list><item><p>1. That the General Assembly of Georgia does hereby endorse and approve the immediate construction, as a war measure by the Federal government, of the proposed canal and inland waterway, extending the Mississippi and Mobile Rivers to the Atlantic seaboard, for the purposes of barge transportation; and the immediate development of the port at Cumberland Sound, as a bunker coal port; and the utilization of the facilities of that port for wharves, dry docks, repair facilities, and as a means for maintaining the navy and mercantile marine of the United States. <sidenote>Endorsement and approval of waterway.</sidenote></p></item><item><p>2.

United States army. As soon as said securities learned of his action, they procured the sheriff of Jefferson county to go to Augusta, Ga., and apprehend their principal and relieve them from liability on said bond: said sheriff went to Augusta, saw the said Tom Irby and talked with him, but failed to apprehend him or take hi minto his custody. Securities set up this fact as defense, in response to rule nisi, but the said court held that it did not constitute a defense, and rule absolute and final judgment were taken on said bond at the March term, 1917, of said court, and execution issued thereon, and is now outstanding against said sureties, and in the hands of either the clerk or sheriff of said court, in Jefferson county, Georgia; and</p><p>Whereas, The said Tom Irby immediately after seeing said sheriff in the government employment as a soldier left Georgia and was for a while stationed at some place in Virginia. He is now serving as a soldier in the United States army. Securities have never been able to get their principal out of said army and bring him to trial.</p><p>Whereas, The prosecution in said case was by an unfriendly brother-in-law of the said Tom Irby, who as administrator of the estate of J. R. Irby, had fraudulently, violently and forcibly dispossessed the said Tom Irby, his mother and other heirs of a certain tract of land, the said Tom Irby only, at the instance of his mother, supervised the cutting of a small quantity of firewood on said land. Since the institution of this prosecution the rights to the title of said tract of land have been litigated between said prosecutor and the mother of said Tom Irby, and by a jury of said county found to be the property of the said Mrs. Irby. Consequently the said Tom Irby would not and could not be convicted, if he could and would appear before said court and stand his trial.</p><p>Be it resolved, That the sheriff of the city court of Louisville and the clerk of the city court of Louisville be and they are now directed to surrender up and cancel the
