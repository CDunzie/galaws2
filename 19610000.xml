<notediv><title><b>Compiler's Note</b><br set="CENTER" /></title><note><p>To speed publication, the Acts and Resolutions of the 1961 session, with the exception of the proposed amendments to the Constitution, were sent to the printer in the order in which they were released from the Governor's office. This made only a broad classification possible.</p><p>General Acts and Resolutions were grouped in one volume beginning at page 1 and running through page 772. The proposed amendments to the Constitution were grouped together beginning at page 595 of Volume One and are followed by a complete index beginning at page 644. This volume is bound separately.</p><p>Local and special Acts and Resolutions were grouped in one volume beginning on page 2001.</p><p>There are no intervening pages between 772 and 2000.</p><p>The index, which is published in full in each volume, covers material included in both volumes. It is in two parts: a broad tabular index which attempts to supply some of the advantages which might have been gained from a more detailed classification, which speed of publication made impossible. This is followed by a regular alphabetical index.</p></note></notediv><body><part><title>ACTS AND RESOLUTIONS<br set="CENTER">OF THE<br set="CENTER"><b>GENERAL ASSEMBLY</b><br set="CENTER">OF THE<br set="CENTER"><b>STATE OF GEORGIA</b><br set="CENTER"><b>1961</b><br set="CENTER" /></br></br></br></br></br></title><law id="L1961V2N001" initial.page="2003" type="INFERRED"><shorttitle>CITY COURT OF BAXLEYSOLICITOR, JURIES.</shorttitle><lawnbr>No. 3</lawnbr><origin>(House Bill No. 20).</origin><fulltitle>An Act to amend an Act establishing the City Court of Baxley, Appling County, approved December 1, 1897 (Ga.

Roll of Assessments; Protests</b>: Whenever

any of the aforesaid paving or other improvements have been authorized, either by petition of property owners or by resolution of the Board of Commissioners and the contract therefor has been let and the cost of such improvements has been ascertained, which cost shall include all the expenses incurred by the city incident to such improvements, including the cost of intersection on any street or streets to be paved, the Board of Commissioners of said city shall by written resolution apportion the cost and expense of the same pro rata per lineal foot front to the several tracts, lots, or parcels of land, including the street intersections to be assessed against said city, and shall cause to be made up a written report or assessment of such expense and cost to the several lots and tracts of land abutting on such streets, alleys, sidewalks, or other public places so improved, including a general description of such tracts of land and the names of the reputed owners thereof. And said report or assessment-roll shall be filed with the city clerk of the City of Jesup. When said report or assessment-roll has been thus filed, a notice signed by the city clerk or city manager shall be published one (1) time in the newspaper in which advertisements of sheriff's sales are published in Wayne County, giving a description of the streets, sidewalks, alleys, or other public places paved or otherwise improved, and stating that the cost thereof has been ascertained and the assessments against all abutting property fixed, and filed with the city clerk, open to inspection, and that any objections or protests may be filed in writing within ten (10) days. Any abutting property owner may, within ten (10) days from the publication of such notice, not including Sundays, file a written protest as to the assessment against his or her property, setting up in said written protest all the grounds thereof. At any regular or called meeting of the Board of Commissioners after the expiration of ten (10) days from the publication of the aforesaid notice, said Board of Commissioners shall hear and determine all such protests or objections that may be filed within the ten-day period to said assessments, and shall have power to confirm said assessments as first made, or to review and amend same as justice may require, and

<page id="GA1961.2.P342" no="GA1961.2.2342" />

then confirm same as amended. The confirming of such assessments shall be by ordinance, which shall be known as the assessment ordinance, and on the passage of such assessment ordinance said assessments shall be considered duly levied. Such assessment-roll as thus finally confirmed shall be duly certified as correct by the clerk of the City of Jesup, and shall be recorded on the mortgage records of Wayne County, as further notice of such assessments on the various parcels of land therein described.</p><p><b>Section 7. Liens of Assessments</b>: Such assessments and all installments thereof together with interest thereon, shall be a special lien against the tracts, parcels, or lots of land so assessed, from the date of the ordinance levying such assessments, such lien to be equal with the other taxes, and prior and superior to all other liens against such lots or parcels of land, until finally paid with all interest and charges thereof.</p><p><b>Section 8.

All such payments shall be made to the clerk of the City of Jesup unless otherwise provided by the Board of Commissioners who shall issue proper receipts therefor and keep an accurate account of such collections thus made by him, which collections shall be kept as a separate fund to be used and applied to the payment of such bonds or assessments and the interest thereon as may be issued under authority of this Act, and such funds shall be used for no other purpose. Provided, however, the owners of the property assessed shall have the privilege of paying the amount assessed against their property within thirty (30) days from the date of the passage of the assessment ordinance, without interest, thereby relieving such property from the lien of such assessment.</p>

<p><b>Section 9. Additional Assessments</b>: In the event any assessment shall be found to be invalid, inaccurate or for any reason insufficient in whole or in part, the Board of Commissioners may at any time, in the manner provided for the making of an original assessment, proceed to cause a new assessment be made and affixed, it shall have like force and effect as an original assessment.</p><p><b>Section 10. Default in Installments</b>: Upon failure of any property owner to pay any installment when due of any assessment herein levied, the City of Jesup is authorized to issue its execution against such property owner and such property for the whole amount of the assessment against such property remaining unpaid, with interest thereon, and to enforce the payment thereof by levy and sale, which execution shall be issued and sales thereunder conducted as in the case of the issuance of executions and sales for other city taxes, and such sale shall vest in the purchaser absolute title to the property sold. And as against any assessments or any part thereof for the improvements herein provided for and the enforcement of the same by execution and levy, and abutting property owner shall have the right to file an affidavit of illegality, returnable to the superior court of Wayne County, and to contest the legality of such assessment, which affidavit shall set forth in detail the reason why the affiant claims the execution is proceeding illegally; and if any part of said execution is admitted to be due, the affiant shall pay the same to the levying officer before such levying officer shall be required to receive and return said affidavit of illegality to the superior court of Wayne County. When said affidavit is filed, the same shall be tried and determined as in other cases of illegality, subject to all penalties provided by law in cases where such proceedings are filed for delay only; and said affiant shall be required to give bond with good and sufficient security for the payment of costs in the event said illegality is not sustained, or in lieu of such bond may file an affidavit in forma pauperis as provided in claim cases.</p><p><b>Section 11.
