They shall not be confined to the list furnished them by the clerk of said town of persons who have failed to make returns nor by the list of property in said town not returned for taxation furnished to them by said clerk, but shall make independent investigation to ascertain whether or not there are other owners of taxable property who have failed to make returns, and other taxable property which has not been returned.

After having revised said tax returns, said Tax Equalizers shall turn back to said clerk all of said tax returns, including all returns made out by them for persons who failed to make returns with the result of their findings clearly and plainly indicated thereon. They shall not state generally that the returns of a person is increased, but shall indicate what property returned thereon is increased in value by them, and what property is added thereto by them (if any omitted property is added by them) with its value as found to be by them. After receiving said revised returns from said Tax Equalizers, the clerk of said town shall immediately notify the Mayor of said town, who shall fix a time when objections, if there are any, to the findings of the Tax Equalizers will be heard at the council chamber of said town in an open session of the town council by the Mayor and Aldermen of said town, and said clerk shall immediately give written notice by mail to each person whose returns have been increased by said Tax Equalizers of the time and place fixed by said Mayor for hearing objections, at least ten days before said time of hearing.
