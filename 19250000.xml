The first installment of the principal shall mature at the expiration of three years from the date of issue, and one installment each succeeding year for nine additional years.

The necessary books and blanks for this purpose shall be provided at the expense of the Drainage District. The tax collector shall, not later than January 1st of each year, make a report of all unpaid assessments due for the preceding year to the Board of Drainage Commissioners, and shall at the same time issue his executions to enforce collection of the same, which shall proceed as ordinary executions for State and county taxes; all unpaid assessments shall bear interest at the rate of 7 per cent, per annum from December 20th until paid, and shall be collected by the tax collector in the same manner as the assessment.
