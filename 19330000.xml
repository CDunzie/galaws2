All funds belonging to the State or any of its bureaus, commissions, boards, and/or departments shall be deposited in some designated State depository. The county authorities shall designate one or more solvent bank or banks as depositories of all county moneys and moneys belonging to the school funds of the county, and of school districts therein, and of other districts therein organized for any purpose; and if the county authorities shall not have provided for such a depository, the county board of education or the trustees of any school district or the proper authorities having supervision over any other public fund may designate such a depository as to their funds; and if there be no applicable depository selected, the officer collecting or holding any public funds may select a depository. The proper authorities shall require the depository to give bond or make deposit of securities in trust to secure such deposits as may be made in it. Any bank in this State is authorized to

The crossing of the Ogeechee river at Fort Argyle can easily be made on account of the narrowness of the river at that point. Proceeding south after the road crosses the little Ogeechee, I would suggest an offshoot to be constructed in a southeast direction, connecting with the Coastal Highway at approximately the thirteen-mile post. After the highway crosses the big Ogeechee, the line would be built direct into Clyde, or could tap No. 30 just east of Clyde, using the latter number into Clyde proper. Of course this could be determined by the engineers. I would suggest also a branch line leaving No. 30 at approximately the half-way point between Clyde and Pembroke, following a direct route to Morgan's Bridge and over the Pine Barren road, tapping No. 26 approximately at the eightmile post into our city. <sidenote>Highway mileage, additions to.</sidenote></p><p>Section 2.
