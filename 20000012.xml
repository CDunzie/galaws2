of

article;". 
SECTION 
2. 
Said 
article 
is 
further 
amended 
by 
adding 
at 
the 
end 
thereof 
a 
new 
Part 
3 
to 
read 
as 
follows: 
"Part 
3 
49-5-156. 
(a) 
This 
Code 
section 
shall 
be 
known 
and 
may 
be 
cited 
as 
the 
'Georgia 
Mentoring 
Act 
of 
2000.' 
(b) 
The 
General 
Assembly 
finds 
that: 
( 
1) 
Every 
child 
in 
this 
state 
is 
encouraged 
to 
have 
a 
caring 
adult 
who, 
along 
with 
parents 
and 
teachers, 
is 
able 
to 
offer 
support, 
friendship, 
couragement, 
and 
motivation 
to 
help 
the 
child 
excel 
academically 
and 
lead 
a 
productive 
life; 
(2) 
As 
a 
society, 
we 
look 
to 
a 
child's 
family 
to 
provide 
a 
supportive 
home 
environment 
and 
realize 
that 
the 
primary 
responsibility 
for 
child 
rearing 
must 
remain 
with 
the 
family. 
However, 
we 
are 
keenly 
aware 
of 
increases 
in 
child 
abuse 
and 
neglect, 
the 
escalation 
of 
drug 
and 
alcohol 
abuse, 
and 
that 
many 
children 
who 
could 
excel 
in 
school 
are 
not 
receiving 
all 
the 
help 
and 
support 
they 
need 
to 
succeed; 
(3) 
Untapped 
human 
resources 
exist 
in 
local 
communities 
throughout 
the 
state 
that 
can 
provide 
many 
children 
with 
an 
additional 
caring, 
tive 
academic 
role 
model 
or 
mentor. 
These 
individuals 
will 
help 
those 
children 
progress 
in 
school 
and 
help 
direct 
and 
reinforce 
the 
many 
portunities 
that 
will 
further 
enhance 
each 
child's 
life; 
(4) 
The 
members 
of 
the 
private 
sector 
throughout 
this 
state 
should 
be 
commended 
for 
their 
generous 
financial 
support 
of 
public 
schools. 
Now 
there 
is 
another 
significant 
contribution 
they 
can 
and 
must 
make 
to 
gia's 
children 
and 
youth: 
the 
investment 
of 
human 
capital 
in 
our 
dren's 
future 
as 
academic 
volunteers 
and 
mentors; 
(5) 
Programs 
which 
provide 
encouragement 
and 
support 
to 
children 
through 
the 
use 
of 
mentors 
have 
resulted 
in 
significant 
increases 
in 
ation 
rates 
at 
the 
secondary 
level 
and 
in 
much 
improved 
enrollment 
rates 
in 
postsecondary 
education 
for 
some 
of 
our 
most 
vulnerable 
youth; 
(6) 
Local, 
regional, 
and 
state-wide 
resource 
referral 
systems 
must 
be 
lished 
to 
link 
more 
efficiently 
children 
and 
potential 
academic 
volunteers 
and 
mentors 
with 
existing 
programs 
and 
organizations;

Nothing 
in 
this

shall 
be 
construed 
to 
limit 
the

(c) 
A

shall 
undertake 
all 
reasonable 
efforts 
to 
provide 
equal 
letic 
opportunity 
for 
members 
of 
both 
genders. 
In 
determining 
whether 
equal 
opportunities 
are 
available 
the 
following 
factors 
shall 
be 
considered: 
( 
1) 
Whether 
the 
selection 
of 
sports 
and 
levels 
of 
competition 
effectively 
accommodate 
the 
interests 
and 
abilities 
of 
members 
of 
both 
genders; 
(2) 
The 
provision 
of 
equipment 
and 
supplies; 
(3) 
Scheduling 
of 
games 
and 
practice 
time; 
( 
4) 
Travel 
allowance; 
(5) 
Opportunity 
to 
receive 
coaching 
and 
academic 
tutoring; 
(6) 
Assignment 
and 
compensation 
of 
coaches 
and 
tutors; 
(7) 
Provision 
of 
locker 
rooms 
and 
practice 
and 
competitive 
facilities; 
(8) 
Provision 
of 
medical 
and 
training 
facilities 
and 
services; 
and 
(9) 
Publicity. 
Unequal 
aggregate 
expenditures 
for 
members 
of 
each 
gender 
or 
unequal 
expenditures 
for 
male 
and 
female 
teams 
if 
a 
local 
school 
system 
operates 
or 
sponsors 
separate 
teams 
will 
not 
constitute 
noncompliance 
with 
this 
tion, 
but 
the 
failure 
to 
provide 
essential 
funds 
for 
the 
basic 
operations 
of 
teams 
for 
one 
gender 
may 
be 
considered 
in 
assessing 
equality 
of 
opportunity 
for 
members 
of 
each 
gender. 
Nothing 
in 
Code 
Section 
20-2411 
shall 
be 
construed 
to 
limit 
the 
authority 
of 
a 
local 
school 
system 
to 
expend 
school 
tax 
funds 
as 
authorized 
by

the 
following: 
"29-4-4.1. 
(a) 
(1) 
The 
judge 
of 
the 
probate 
court 
of 
the 
county 
in 
which 
the 
minor 
is 
found 
shall 
have 
the 
power 
to 
appoint 
a 
temporary 
guardian 
of 
the 
son 
or 
property, 
or 
both, 
of 
the 
minor 
when 
the

is 
alleged 
by 
the

having 
actual 
physical 
custody 
of 
such 
minor 
to 
be 
in 
need 
of 
a

or

required 
in 
this 
Code 
section 
is 
given

if 
objection 
is 
filed 
by 
a 
natural 
guardian. 
(2) 
Provided 
the 
requirements 
in 
paragraph 
(1) 
of 
this 
subsection 
are 
met, 
if 
such 
minor 
is 
above 
the 
age 
of 
14 
years 
before 
a 
temporary 
ian 
is 
appointed, 
the 
minor 
shall 
have 
the 
privilege 
of 
selecting 
a 
rary 
guardian. 
If 
the 
selection 
is 
judicious, 
the 
judge 
of 
the 
probate 
court 
shall 
appoint 
the 
temporary 
guardian 
so 
selected. 
Having 
once

must 
honor 
such 
preference 
if 
it 
is 
stated 
in

Otherwise, 
the

but 
for 
good 
cause 
shown 
in

a 
preference 
and

A

AVOID 
UNNECESSARY 
COSTS 
OF 
SERVICE 
OF 
SUMMONS 
Subsection 
(d) 
of 
Code 
Section 
9-114 
of 
the 
Official 
Code 
of 
Georgia 
tated 
requires 
certain 
parties 
to 
cooperate 
in 
saving 
unnecessary 
costs 
of 
vice 
of 
the 
summons 
and 
the 
pleading. 
A 
defendant 
located 
in 
the 
United 
States 
who, 
after 
being 
notified 
of 
an 
action 
and 
asked 
by 
a 
plaintiff 
located 
in 
the 
United 
States 
to 
waive 
service 
of 
a 
summons, 
fails 
to 
do 
so 
will 
be 
quired 
to 
bear 
the 
cost 
of 
such 
service 
unless 
good 
cause 
be 
shown 
for 
such 
defendant's 
failure 
to 
sign 
and 
return 
the 
waiver. 
It 
is 
not 
good 
cause 
for 
a 
failure 
to 
waive 
service 
that 
a 
party 
believes 
that 
the 
complaint 
is 
unfounded, 
or 
that 
the 
action 
has 
been 
brought 
in 
an 
proper 
place 
or 
in 
a 
court 
that 
lacks 
jurisdiction 
over 
the 
subject 
matter 
of 
the 
action 
or 
over 
its 
person 
or 
property.

all 
defenses 
and 
objections 
(except 
any 
relating 
to 
the 
summons 
or 
to 
the 
service 
of 
the 
summons), 
and 
may 
later 
object 
to 
the 
risdiction 
of 
the 
court 
or 
to 
the 
place 
where 
the 
action 
has 
been 
brought. 
A 
defendant 
who 
waives 
service 
must, 
within 
the 
time 
specified 
on 
the 
waiver 
form, 
serve 
on 
the 
plaintiffs 
attorney 
(or 
unrepresented 
plaintiff) 
a 
response 
to 
the 
complaint 
and 
also 
must 
file 
a 
signed 
copy 
of 
the 
response 
with 
the 
court. 
If 
the 
answer 
is 
not 
served 
within 
this 
time, 
a 
default 
ment 
may 
be 
taken 
against 
that 
defendant. 
By 
waiving 
service, 
a 
defendant 
is 
allowed 
more 
time 
to 
answer 
than 
if 
the 
summons 
had 
been 
actually 
served 
when 
the 
request 
for 
waiver 
of 
service 
was 
received."

SECTION 
1. 
Chapter 
41 
of 
Title 
31 
of 
the 
Official 
Code 
of 
Georgia 
Annotated, 
relating 
to 
lead 
poisoning 
prevention, 
is 
amended 
by 
designating 
the 
current 
provisions 
of 
said 
chapter 
as 
Article 
1 
and 
inserting 
a 
new 
Article 
2 
to 
read 
as 
follows: 
"ARTICLE 
2 
3141-10. 
This 
article 
shall 
be 
known 
and 
may 
be 
cited 
as 
the 
'Childhood 
Lead 
sure 
Control 
Act.' 
3141-11. 
(a) 
The 
General 
Assembly 
finds 
that 
childhood 
lead 
poisoning 
prevention 
activities 
are 
currently 
carried 
out 
within 
the 
Environmental 
Health 
and 
jury 
Prevention, 
Epidemiology 
and 
Prevention, 
and 
Laboratory 
Branches 
of 
the 
Division 
of 
Public 
Health. 
These 
activities 
include 
lead 
poisoning 
case 
identification, 
laboratory 
support, 
identification 
of 
exposure 
sources, 
ronmental 
management, 
and 
lead 
hazard 
reduction. 
Childhood 
lead 
poisoning 
cases 
are 
identified 
through 
screening 
tests 
conducted 
by 
public 
health 
clinics 
and 
private 
health 
care 
providers 
and 
by 
laboratory 
reporting 
of 
test 
results. 
In 
1994, 
lead 
poisoning 
was 
established 
as 
a 
notifiable 
tion 
and 
made 
part 
of 
the 
Notifiable 
Disease 
reporting 
system. 
(b) 
The 
General 
Assembly 
further 
finds 
that 
the 
Georgia 
Public 
Health 
oratory 
is 
licensed 
and 
certified 
to 
analyze 
blood 
specimens 
for 
lead. 
tory 
services 
are 
provided 
for 
children 
screened 
in 
public 
health 
clinics 
and 
for 
children 
without 
health 
insurance 
screened 
by 
private 
health 
care 
ers. 
For 
each 
reported 
case 
of 
lead 
poisoning, 
an 
environmental 
tion 
is 
conducted 
to 
identify 
the 
source 
of 
lead. 
Environmental 
health 
cialists 
assess 
the 
primary 
residence 
and 
other 
locations 
frequented 
by 
the 
lead-poisoned 
child. 
Information 
is 
collected 
from 
parents 
and 
caregivers; 
on-site 
surface 
testing 
and 
environmental 
sample 
collection 
and 
analysis 
are 
done 
as 
needed. 
When 
the 
lead 
source 
is 
identified, 
recommendations 
are 
made 
for 
the 
mitigation 
or 
abatement 
of 
the 
lead 
hazard. 
Identified 
lead 
poisoning 
cases 
are 
tracked 
collaboratively 
by 
public 
health 
nurses 
and 
ronmental 
health 
specialists 
to 
assure 
that 
appropriate 
treatment 
is 
received 
and 
that 
the 
child 
does 
not 
reenter 
the 
environment 
where 
the 
exposure 
occurred.

VOL. 
I 
( 
1) 
Prescribed 
burning 
reduces 
naturally 
occurring 
vegetative 
fuels 
within 
forested 
areas. 
Reduction 
of 
such 
fuels 
by 
burning 
reduces 
the 
risk 
and 
severity 
of 
major 
wildfire, 
thereby 
lessening 
the 
threat 
of 
fire 
and 
the 
sulting 
loss 
of 
life 
and 
property; 
(2) 
Georgia's 
ever-increasing 
population 
situates 
urban 
development 
rectly 
adjacent 
to 
fire 
prone 
forest 
lands. 
The 
use 
of 
prescribed 
fire 
to 
manage 
fuels 
in 
interface 
areas 
would 
substantially 
reduce 
the 
threat 
of 
damaging 
wildfire 
in 
urban 
communities; 
(3) 
Forest 
land 
constitutes 
significant 
economic, 
biological, 
and 
aesthetic 
resources 
of 
state-wide 
importance. 
Prescribed 
burning 
on 
forest 
land 
serves 
to 
reduce 
hazardous 
accumulations 
of 
fuels, 
prepare 
sites 
for 
both 
natural 
and 
artificial 
forest 
regeneration, 
improve 
wildlife 
habitat, 
control 
insects 
and 
disease, 
and 
perpetuate 
fire 
dependent 
ecosystems;

State 
and 
federally 
owned 
public 
use 
lands 
such 
as 
state 
parks, 
state 
and 
national 
forests, 
and 
wildlife 
refuges 
receive 
resource 
enhancement 
through 
use 
of 
prescribed 
burning; 
(5) 
As 
Georgia's 
population 
continues 
to 
grow, 
pressures 
from 
liability 
sues 
and 
smoke 
nuisance 
complaints 
cause 
prescribed 
burn 
practitioners 
to 
limit 
prescribed 
burn 
activity, 
thus 
reducing 
the 
above-mentioned 
fits 
to 
the 
state; 
(6) 
Public 
misunderstanding 
of 
the 
benefit 
of 
prescribed 
burning 
to 
the 
ecological 
and 
economic 
welfare 
of 
the 
state 
exerts 
unusual 
pressures 
that 
prevent 
uninhibited 
use 
of 
this 
valuable 
forest 
resource 
management 
tool;

Fire 
benefits

also 
allows

(b) 
It

the

of

Code 
Section 
34-9-
15, 
relating 
to 
the 
procedure 
for 
settlement 
between 
parties 
generally, 
and 
serting 
in 
lieu 
thereof 
the 
following: 
"34-9-15. 
(a) 
Nothing 
contained 
in 
this 
chapter 
shall 
be 
construed 
so 
as 
to 
prevent 
settlements 
made 
by 
and 
between 
the 
employee 
and 
employer 
but 
rather 
to 
encourage 
them, 
so 
long 
as 
the 
amount 
of 
compensation 
and 
the 
time 
and 
manner 
of 
payment 
are 
in 
accordance 
with 
this 
chapter. 
A 
workers' 
pensation 
insurer 
shall 
not 
be 
authorized 
to 
settle 
a 
claim 
on 
behalf 
of 
its 
insured 
employer 
without 
giving 
prior 
notice 
to 
such 
employer 
of 
the 
terms 
of 
the 
settlement 
agreement. 
A 
copy 
of 
any 
such 
settlement 
agreement 
shall 
be 
filed 
by 
the 
employer 
with 
the 
board, 
and 
no 
such 
settlement 
shall 
be 
binding 
until 
approved 
by 
the 
board. 
Whenever 
it 
shall 
appear 
to 
the 
board, 
by 
stipulation 
of 
the 
parties 
or 
otherwise, 
that 
there 
is 
a 
bona 
fide 
dispute 
as 
to 
facts, 
the 
determination 
of 
which 
will 
materially 
affect 
the 
right 
of 
the 
employee 
or 
dependent 
to 
recover 
compensation 
or 
the 
amount 
of 
compensation 
to 
be 
recovered, 
or 
that 
there 
is 
a 
genuine 
dispute 
as 
to 
the 
applicability 
of 
this 
chapter, 
and 
it 
further 
appears 
that 
the 
parties 
have 
agreed 
upon 
a 
settlement 
between 
themselves, 
which 
settlement 
gives 
due 
regard 
and 
weight 
to 
the 
conflicting 
evidence 
available 
relating 
to 
the 
puted 
facts 
or 
to 
the 
questions 
as 
to 
the 
applicability 
of 
this 
chapter, 
then, 
upon 
such 
determination, 
the 
board 
shall 
approve 
the 
settlement 
and 
enter 
an 
award 
conforming 
to 
the 
terms 
thereof 
even 
though 
such 
settlement 
may 
provide 
for 
the 
payment 
of 
compensation 
in 
a 
sum 
or 
sums 
less 
than 
would 
be 
payable 
if 
there 
were 
no 
conflict 
as 
to 
the 
employee's 
right 
to 
recover 
compensation. 
When 
such 
settlement 
has 
been 
agreed 
upon 
and 
approved 
by 
the 
board, 
it 
shall 
constitute 
a 
complete 
and 
final 
disposition 
of 
all 
claims 
on 
account 
of 
the 
incident, 
injury, 
or 
injuries 
referred 
to 
therein, 
and 
the 
board 
shall 
not 
be 
authorized 
to 
enter 
upon 
any 
award 
subsequent 
to 
such 
board 
approval 
amending, 
modifying, 
or 
changing 
in 
any 
manner 
the 
ment, 
nor 
shall 
the 
settlement 
be 
subject 
to 
review 
by 
the 
board 
under 
Code 
Section 
34-9-104. 
(b) 
The 
board 
shall 
be 
authorized 
to 
approve 
a 
stipulated 
settlement 
tween 
the 
parties 
which 
concludes 
that 
there 
is 
no 
liability 
under 
this 
ter 
and 
to 
retain 
jurisdiction 
to 
enforce 
any 
agreement 
which 
resolves, 
in 
whole 
or 
in 
part, 
a 
claim 
filed 
with 
the 
board. 
If 
payments 
required 
under 
such 
an 
agreement 
are 
not 
made 
within 
20 
days, 
the 
board 
may

a 
alty 
of 
20 
percent 
in 
the

used 
as

campsite 
for 
both

As 
though 
it

in 
the 
Varnell 
Community; 
and 
WHEREAS, 
as 
local 
history 
records, 
Prater's 
Mill

the 
two 
country 
fairs 
each 
year 
with 
arts 
and 
crafts 
for 
the 
past 
29 
years 
indicates 
that 
the 
mill 
has 
a 
great 
future;

history 
records, 
the 
founder
