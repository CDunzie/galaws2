						<p>Sec. 4. Every wholesale dealer in this State shall, before shipping, delivering, or sending out any cigars or cigarettes to any retail dealer in this State or for sale in this State, cause the same to have the requisite denominations and amount of stamp or stamps, to represent the tax, affixed as stated herein, and cause the same to be cancelled by writing or stamping across the face thereof the name of such wholesale dealer and the date; and every other wholesale dealer may do so; and such wholesale dealer, at the time of shipping or delivering any cigars or cigarettes, shall make a true duplicate invoice of the same, showing the date, amount, and value of each class of articles shipped or delivered, and retain a duplicate thereof, subject to the use and inspection of the Commissioner of Revenue and his representatives for two years.

						<p>(c) In the case of property acquired by bequest, devise, or inheritance, after August 22, 1929, the basis shall be the fair market value of such property at the time of such acquisition.</p>

The remainder, if any, of the gain recognized under paragraph 4 shall be taxed as a gain from the exchange of property.</p>
						<p>6. SameGain of corporation. If an exchange would be within the provisions of subsection 3 of this section if it were not for the fact that the property received in exchange consists not only of stock or securities permitted by such paragraph to be received without the recognition of gain, but also of other property or money, then (1) if the corporation receiving such other property or money distributes it in pursuance of the plan of reorganization, no gain to the corporation shall be recognized from the exchange; but (2) if the corporation receiving such other property or money does not distribute it in pursuance of the plan of reorganization, the gain, if any, to the corporation, shall be recognized, but in an amount not in excess of the sum of such money and the fair market value of such other property so received, which is not so distributed.</p>

						<p>Whereas attention of the General Assembly has been officially directed to present inadequate facilities for handling and caring for certain wards dependent upon the State, and to the deplorable conditions at certain institutions; and whereas official documents and correspondence emphasize that all available space at the State Sanitarium has been utilized, and the inability of the authorities of that institution to receive and properly care for all the patients in the State who have been committed to that institution and that for lack of room a large number of unfortunate mentally deficient people are detained in the jails of the State; and whereas the State Prison Commission has found it necessary to call upon the General Assembly to take immediate steps to make some provision that will enable the Prison Commission to care for, handle and house the convicts who are rapidly being turned back to the State by counties to which they have heretofore been alloted, and to devise some method or methods by which such convicts may be

						<shorttitle>MULBERRY GROVE MEMORIAL TO CONGRESS.</shorttitle>
						<lawnbr>N0. 10.</lawnbr>
						<fulltitle>Be it remembered, that when the fortunes of the American colonies were at the lowest ebb, Washington sent to the south Major-General Nathaniel Greene, of Rhode Island, in the hope that the great military genius of this soldier, who has been described as perhaps the ablest general officer of the Revolution next to Washington, might succeed in devising means to relieve these communities of the awful affliction of British occupation and partisan warfare; and be it further remembered that Washington's faith in Greene was justified by the action of the latter in compelling Cornwallis and Tarleton to move north, resulting finally in the surrender of the former at Yorktown; thus, in effect, ending successfully the struggle for political freedom.</fulltitle>
						<p>Be it further remembered, that at the conclusion of the Revolutionary War the State of Georgia made a practical expression of its gratitude to General Greene by presenting to him that certain plantation of 2,000 acres near Savannah, in the County of Chatham, Georgia, known as Mulberry Grove, on which plantation General Greene resided until his death on the 19th day of June, 1786. 
							<sidenote>Preamble.</sidenote></p>
						<p>And be it further remembered, that another hero of the Revolution was associated with said Mulberry Grove, in that Major-General Anthony Wayne of Pennsylvania, known affectionately to his soldiers, because of his extreme


							<page id="GA1931.2.P130" no="GA1931.2.134"/>
							gallantry, as Mad Anthony Wayne, was the owner by presentation from the State of Georgia of the two adjoining plantations, on one of which he resided and from which he made frequent visits to General Greene at Mulberry Grove and was with him at his death.</p>
						<p>And be it further remembered, that Eli Whitney, of the State of Massachusetts, was a visitor to the family of General Greene after his death and resided with them on said Mulberry Grove.</p>
						<p>And be it further remembered, that while said Whitney was a member of the late General Green's household on Mulberry Grove he invented the cotton-gin, and that this invention was, perhaps, the greatest mechanical boon ever conferred on the farmers of the South and the manufacturers of the nation.</p>
						<p>So that, because of its association with these soldiers and this inventor, Mulberry Grove may be described as one of the shrines of the American people, to whom it should belong, and by whom it should be preserved as a memorial to these Americans.</p>
						<p>Therefore be it resolved by the General Assembly of Georgia, that the congress of the United States be requested to secure, by purchase or otherwise, said Mulberry Grove plantation, and to do necessary things, by legislation or otherwise, to declare the same a national park and to hold the same as such, in perpetuity, as a memorial to Major-General Nathaniel Greene, Major-General Anthony Wayne, and Eli Whitney, and that the name Greene-Wayne-Whitney National Park be given it. 
							<sidenote>Request that Congress acquire Mulberry Grove plantation and name it Greene-Wayne-Whitney National Park.</sidenote></p>
						<p>Resolved further, that copies of this resolution be forwarded by the Governor of this State, to the Vice-President of the United States, and the Speaker of the Congress of the United States, to be laid before the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States, and that Honorable Charles G.
