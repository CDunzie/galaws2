The beginning date of such base period for any milk shed shall not be modified except after notice in writing thereof mailed to each licensed producer, licensed producer-distributor, and licensed distributor in such milk shed at least six months prior to the different beginning date the board intends to establish. Each such order shall establish a price applicable to base milk and a lower price applicable to excess milk. `Base milk' shall be that quantity of milk delivered by any producer into a milk shed and there accepted by one or more producer-distributors or distributors during an established base period. The average daily amount of

VIII.</sidenote></p><p><blockquote><p>The County Board of Education of Effingham County shall, within one year after the date of ratification of this amendment, divide all of the territory of Effingham County outside of independent school systems established prior to the adoption of the 1945 Constitution into political subdivisions to be known as local schoolhouse districts. When such division is made the entire county shall be so divided into separate subdivisions. The local subdivisions so set up and established shall be clearly and positively defined by the resolution passed by the board establishing such subdivisions. The same shall be marked off in the manner which the board deems to be most advantageous to the school interest of the county. The county board of education shall act as officers of such local subdivision, and as such are hereby authorized to incur bonded indebtedness for the purpose of purchasing school sites and for building and equipping, enlarging and repairing schoolhouses in and for such local subdivisions. The bonded indebtedness which the county board of education is hereby authorized to incur shall be incurred pursuant to Article VII, Section VII, Paragraphs I and II of the Constitution of 1945. An election for bonds for such local subdivisions shall be called and held in the manner prescribed by Chapter 87-2 of the Code of Georgia of 1933, as amended,

and the bonds shall be validated in the manner prescribed by Chapter 87-3 of the Code of Georgia of 1933, as amended. The purpose of this section is to permit and to require the same procedure to be followed in the voting, issuance, levying of taxes for, and the retirement of bonds issued by the county boards of education for local subdivisions herein established, for building and equipping, enlarging and repairing schoolhouses or purchasing sites therefor, as is required in the case of municipalities and other county bonds. Provided, however, that where the county board of education divides the county into subdivisions and seeks to issue bonds for any one of the local subdivisions, persons residing outside of the local subdivisions may not participate as qualified voters in said election. Should the election held in a local subdivision result favorably to the issuance of bonds for such local subdivision, the property located within such local subdivision as marked off and established by the county board of education shall be subject to taxation for the retirement of bonds issued by the county board of education for such local subdivision. The property located outside of such subdivision shall not be subject to taxation for the retirement of any bonds issued for the local subdivision. <sidenote>Effingham County Board of Education.</sidenote></p><p>It is not intended that this amendment shall in any way interfere with the county board of education issuing bonds on a county-wide basis as provided for in Section 23 of the Act approved February 1, 1946.

The said mayor and council shall have full power and authority to assess two-thirds of the cost of laying said sewer against the real estate abutting on each side of the street or alley down which such sewer is laid, one-third of such costs to be borne by the city, and the other two-thirds by the abutting property owners in just proportion to the frontage by the foot of said property; provided, corner property shall be assessed as follows: (A) Where the sewer abuts property only on the front, the property shall be assessed for the amount of frontage, (B) Where the sewer abuts property on both the front and the side, the property shall be assessed for the frontage, and the first 150 feet of the side shall be exempted from assessment, (C) Where the sewer abuts property only on the side the first 150 feet of the side shall be exempted from assessment; Provided further, that whenever property has been exempted from assessment for abutting sewers and such property should thereafter be so improved or the condition thereof changes, or the situation is such, that the owner thereof desires a sewer connection from the sewer for which no assessment against such property was made, the owner shall be required to pay the amount said property would have been assessed except for the exemption recognized. The amount of the assessment on each piece of real estate shall be a lien thereon from the date of the passage of the ordinance providing for the work and making the assessment, which lien shall be superior to all

Should any owner of any property upon which such an execution is levied desire to contest the legality or amount of the assessment, they may do so by filing with the levying officer an affidavit of illegality, and stating therein the cause of such illegality and the amount, if any, admitted to be due, which amount admitted to be due shall be paid the levying officer before the affidavit shall be received, and the affidavit shall be returned to the superior court of the county in which said property is located to be tried and determined as in other cases of illegality, subject to the penalties for delay in such cases made and provided; and it shall be the duty of the judge of the superior court to give preference to those cases over all other pending cases in said court. Said mayor and council shall in all cases, in their discretion, have the power to grant a stay of execution for said assessment for such times as they may see fit, and collect the interest on the same at the rate of seven (7) percent per annum. Said mayor and council shall have the right, and power to make the improvements provided for in this section of this Act, by and through its own employees, or enter into a contract or contracts for said improvements with any person, firm, or corporation, and in payment thereof may assign and transfer to such person, firm or corporation, bills or executions covering assessments made against the abutting property, and the owners thereof for said improvements. <sidenote>Sewer assessments.</sidenote></p></blockquote></p><p>Section 2.

Be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, that prior to each election of any kind or character, or for whatever purpose, to be held in said city, the city clerk shall make out three copies of a list or lists, in alphabetical order and according to wards, of all persons who, up to and including the sixtieth day prior to the date of such election, will be eighteen years of age, and will have resided in the State and city for the required period; and shall furnish such list or lists prior to the date of such election, to a board of registrars appointed by the mayor and council as herein provided. In the case of a person who has, since his registration, moved his residence from one ward to another ward in said city, and who is, or will have become a bona fide resident of said later ward at least three days continuously preceding the date of such election, his name shall be placed upon the list of registered voters for the ward to which

<page id="GA1952.1.P1216" no="GA1952.1.2591" />

he has moved and in which he shall reside at the time of such election, and such person, if qualified, shall be entitled to vote in such election in the ward to which he has so moved, and so resides. The mayor and council shall appoint, either annually for all elections to be held during any year, or for such election, three persons, who shall be registered voters of the city, who shall constitute and be known as the board of registrars of said city. Neither the city clerk nor any of the assistant registrars hereinabove provided for shall be eligible to membership on said board, but any member of council may be appointed as a member thereof. It shall be the duty of said board of registrars, to receive, examine and purge said lists of registered voters so furnished them, as aforesaid, by striking and removing therefrom, before the day of election, the names of all persons who have died, or who have removed from the city, and also the names of all persons who on or before said sixtieth day prior to such election, may have become, or may be disqualified for any other reason to vote in the election prior to which such lists are furnished as aforesaid, including any person who will be under the age of eighteen years or who will not have resided in the State and city for the requisite periods, on the day of such election. In purging said lists said board shall act upon the best evidence or information obtainable within the time available therefor. Said board of registrars shall furnish to the city clerk a list or lists of the names so purged, stricken and removed by them, and said city clerk shall strike and mark said names from the voters' book, and a registrant so stricken and marked from said book shall not be entitled to vote in any election in the city until such registrant has qualified and again registered under the terms of this Act, or unless his name has been restored to said book as herein provided. Said board of registrars shall notify each person whose name is purged, stricken and removed by them, as aforesaid, of that fact, by mailing written notice thereof to such person at the address appearing on the voters' book or oaths signed by such person, or by having the same personally served upon such person, or left at his place of residence; and if such person claims that his or her name has been improperly purged, stricken and removed by

<page id="GA1952.1.P1217" no="GA1952.1.2592" />

said board of registrars, such person may make written complaint thereof to said board by leaving same with the city clerk at the city hall in said city, and shall be entitled to be heard thereon by said board, at such time and place as may be fixed by said board, after notice thereof in either of the methods above stated. Said notice, however, may be waived by such person, and, in case of waiver, hearing afforded by said board, without notice in its discretion. The action of said board on such complaints shall be final; and if said board finds that the name of such person was improperly stricken and removed, said board shall restore same to the list of registered voters from which it was stricken, and notify the city clerk in writing accordingly, who shall likewise restore same to the voters' book by entry of that fact on such person's oath therein. With respect to any person whose name has been purged, stricken and removed by said board at such time before the day of election that sufficient opportunity may not be afforded for notice and hearing of any complaint prior to the day of such election as herein provided, said board shall give such notice as is reasonably possible, and hear such complaint on the day of the election, and if said board finds that the name of such person has been improperly stricken and removed, said board shall notify the city clerk in writing accordingly, who shall thereupon restore same to the voters' book by entry as above provided, and said board shall furnish to such person whose name has been thus restored, a certificate in form to be provided by the mayor and council, signed by the members of said board, or a majority of them, to the effect that such person's name has been restored to the voters' book, and that he or she is entitled to vote in such election; which certificate, upon presentation and surrender to the manager of the election at the voting precinct where such person is entitled to vote, shall entitle such person to vote in said election. The managers of election shall, upon the presentation and surrender of such certificate, add the name of such person to the official lists of registered voters being used in said election at such voting precinct, followed by the word `certificate'; and all such certificates shall be preserved by the election managers and filed by them with

Section 21 of said Act as amended, and who do retire, or become entitled to retire on a standard service pension because of having at or after attaining the age of fifty-five (55) years both the minimum age and the length of service requireed by law for retirement on a standard service pension, the amount of any pension payable to the widow or minor children of such member shall be increased by the amount of three and 75/100 ($3.75) dollars per month for each additional year of service rendered by the person upon whose service such right to a pension depends after such person had both the minimum age and length of service required by law for retirement on a standard service pension.

In either case, the amount of the increase in pension allowed to a retired member after attainment of such minimum qualifications for a standard service pension would be the sum of five and 00/100 ($5.00) dollars per month for each additional full year of service thereafter rendered as an officer, deputy or employee and if the widow, or minor children become entitled to receive, or to succeed to a pension, the amount of such pension to such surviving beneficiary would because of the same extra years of service be increased by the amount of three and 75/100 ($3.75) dollars per
