License of Agents by Insurance Commissioner. No licensed fire or casualty insurance company or company writing fidelity or surety bonds, shall write or issue any policy or indemnity contract on any risk in this State except through a resident agent licensed by the Insurance Commissioner: Provided that no contract bond shall be issued by any company, except through an agent, resident of the county in which the work under contract is located, if the company has an agent, resident in the county in question. The full commission thereon, (meaning thereby the commission paid for the production of business by him) shall be paid to such resident agent. Provided, however, that such resident agent may pay a commission on business placed with him by another duly licensed resident agent, and, provided further, that such resident agent may pay a commission not exceeding fifty per centum of the regular commission allowed resident agents upon the issuance of such policies or contracts, to a duly licensed non-resident on any business originated by such non-resident. This section shall not apply to policies covering property in transit while in the custody of any common carrier or to rolling stock of any common carrier, nor to cotton insurance issued under a per bale reporting form of coverage. The words `resident agent' as used in this section are deemed to mean resident agents engaged in the solicitation of such business from the public generally and shall not include any salaried employee of any insurance company doing business in this State; but shall include any agents of mutual insurance companies however compensated. Nothing in this section, however, shall be construed to relieve from license requirements any

No person except as hereinafter provided shall be licensed as an insurance agent except upon the application of a company authorized to do business in this State, which said application shall be accompanied by a certificate signed by an executive officer of such company and certifying that after inquiring into the facts to the best knowledge, judgment and belief of such company, such person is of good character, is now a bona fide resident of the State of Georgia, and in good faith intends to remain as such resident for a period of twelve (12) months or more from the date of the filing of said application, and is or expects to become bona fide engaged in the business of an insurance agent (as defined in this Act), that he has such moral and financial standing as to make it probable that he can carry on such an agency without detriment to the public, that he expects bona fide to solicit and serve the public generally and not to procure the license chiefly for the purpose of getting a rebate or commission on insurance written for himself or his family or some partnership or corporation in which he is interested or with which he is connected, and that he has such knowledge of the business and of the law and practices governing and relating to the same as will enable him to carry on the business in a competent manner and without detriment to the public. <sidenote>License of insurance agent.</sidenote></p></blockquote></p><p>56-508(a).

When it is shown from such application and examination that the applicant is intending in good faith to act as an insurance agent or solicitor and to be principally engaged in the insurance business and is of good character, is now a bona fide resident of the State of Georgia, and in good faith intends to remain as such resident for a period of twelve (12) months or more from the date of the filing of said application, and is or expects to become bona fide engaged in the business of an insurance agent (as defined in this Act), that the has such moral and financial standings as to make it probable that he can carry on such an agency without detriment to the public, that he expects bona fide to solicit and serve the public generally and not to procure the license chiefly for the purpose of getting a rebate or commission on insurance written for himself or his family or some partnership or corporation in which he is interested or with which he is connected, and that he has such knowledge of the business and of the law and practices governing and relating to the same as will enable him to carry on the business in a competent manner and without detriment to the public, and is worthy of a license, the Insurance Commissioner shall issue to the applicant a license to transact business in this State as an insurance agent or solicitor.

Temporary license. In the event of the death or the inability further to act, of an agent holding a certificate of authority from any company, where no other agent in the co-partnership, association or corporation is authorized to represent such company, the Insurance Commissioner may issue a temporary license to another person enabling such other person to represent any such company upon an application being made in conformity with section 2 and the additional information required by this section. Such temporary license shall continue only until the license is afforded an opportunity of taking the examination provided in section 2 above.</p><p>56-508(d). Renewal of licenses.

title to said reserve and also desires to acquire title to approximately 277 acres of marsh land on McQueen's Island in Chatham County, Georgia, on the south side of the South Channel of the Savannah River, to be used as an approach to said monument and for the purpose of constructing a bridge to Cockspur Island, said 277 acres being part of the ungranted and unappropriated lands hereinbefore referred to; and whereas Savannah  Tybee Railway Company acquired and used a right of way on, over, and through said 277-acres tract for the construction and operation of a railway from Savannah to Tybee Island, which right of way was abandoned by its successor in title, Central of Georgia Railway Company, by authority of the Interstate-Commerce Commission and the Public-Service Commission of Georgia; whereupon title to said right of way reverted to the State of Georgia, so that the State of Georgia now has title to said entire tract, except for the right of way for U. S. Highway 80, which runs from Savannah to Tybee Island, Georgia; and whereas, the State of Georgia desires to promote and encourage the establishment and maintenance of Fort Pulaski National Monument, because of its historical and educational value to the people of the State of Georgia; <sidenote>Preamble.</sidenote></p><p>Therefore be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Georgia, and it is hereby enacted by authority of the same:</p><p>Section 1.
